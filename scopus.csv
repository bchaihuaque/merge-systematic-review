We build and estimate a structural cost model where the service is regulated by a local government and is provided by a single operator. Knowledge spillovers are directly linked to the know-how of a specific group, but they also depend on the incentive power of the regulatory contract which shapes the effort of the local managers. Exerting an effort in a specific network allows a cost reduction in this network, but it also benefits other networks that are members of the same group. We find that diversity of knowledge across operators of the same group improves absorptive capacity and increases the flow of spillovers. Simulation exercises provide evidence of significant reductions in total operating costs following the enlargement of industrial groups. © 2022","Absorptive capacity; Cost incentives; Diversity of knowledge; Effort; Knowledge spillovers; Public transport","Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Operating costs; Urban transportation; Absorptive capacity; Cost incentive; Diversity of knowledge; Effort; Incentive contracts; Industrial groups; Knowledge spillovers; Public transport; Urban networks; Urban transport sector; Technology transfer",,,,,"ITEA; Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR: ANR-12- BSH1-0009-01, ANR-17-EURE-0001; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO: ECO2010-20504; Ministério da Educação e Ciência, MEC: SEJ2007-66268; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, UC3M; Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, UAB","The authors acknowledge financial support from the Agence Nationale pour la Recherche , ANR-12- BSH1-0009-01 and EUR grant ANR-17-EURE-0001, Ministerio de Educación y Ciencia ( SEJ2007-66268 ) and Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad (ECO2010-20504).

The model is used to investigate the energy efficiency technological domain in the European Union (EU) using a panel database covering 19 EU countries for the time span 1990–2015. The model is estimated by using a novel empirical strategy which allows to assess the knowledge spillover effects benefiting a country depending on its relative position in the trade network, and correct for common endogeneity concerns. We show that being central in the trade network is a significant determinant of a country’s innovative performance, and that learning-by-exporting mechanisms are responsible for increased innovation performances. We further reveal that neglecting network effects may significantly reduce our understanding of domestic innovation patterns. Finally, we find that the benefits obtained from knowledge diffusion varies with the domestic absorptive capacity and policy mix composition. Our main implication is that policy design informed by network-based case studies could help maximizing the exploitation of positive knowledge spillovers. © 2022, The Author(s).","Energy efficiency; Knowledge spillovers; Network analysis; Residential sector; Technological capability","Economic and social effects; Housing; International trade; Clean energy technology; European union; European Union countries; Knowledge spillover effects; Knowledge spillovers; National innovations; Relative positions; Residential sectors; Technological capability; Time span; Energy efficiency",,,,,"Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR: 20177J2LS9_003","Italian Ministry of University and Research, Scientific Research Program of National Relevance (PRIN) (Grant No.: 20177J2LS9_003)",,,,,,,,,,"Andersson, M., Lööf, H., Learning-by-exporting revisited: The role of intensity and persistence (2009) Scandinavian Journal of Economics, 111 (4), pp. 893-916; Anselin, L., Varga, A., Acs, Z., Local geographic spillovers between university research and high technology innovations (1997) Journal of Urban Economics, 42 (3), pp. 422-448; Knowledge complexity and the mechanisms of knowledge generation and exploitation: The European evidence (2020) Research Policy, Pp, , 104081; Autant-Bernard, C., Spatial econometrics of innovation: Recent contributions and research perspectives (2012) Spatial Economic Analysis, 7 (4), pp. 403-419; Balassa, B., Trade liberalisation and “revealed” comparative advantage (1965) The Manchester School, 33 (2), pp. 99-123; Balland, P.-A., Boschma, R., Crespo, J., Rigby, D.L., Smart specialization policy in the European Union: Relatedness, knowledge complexity and regional diversification (2019) Regional Studies, 53 (9), pp. 1252-1268; Ballester, C., Calvó-Armengol, A., Zenou, Y., Who’s who in networks.

Part of this goal is the study of computer-based systems from conference calls and intranets to more advanced ones like data warehouses, management information systems (MIS) and executive information systems (EIS), as enablers of knowledge flow and absorptive capacity. The paper examines four case studies based on semi-structured interviews, where the data collected highlight a good coverage of computer-based systems in function of knowledge sharing. In half of the cases, this is done internally in the plant and not over the network of plants. We propose to upgrade where possible the systems used in a distributed way to have data and information connections across the network. In some cases, emerge barriers such as lack of time, lack of tolerance for errors, or the need for assistance. Conclusions show that staff training related to computer-based systems in the optics of knowledge enablers is important for the companies, while the incentives are not considered as a key factor for knowledge transfer. © 2022 Vukatana et al.","Computer-based systems; Knowledge transfer; Manufacturing plant; Multinational companies' network",,,,,,"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF: IZ73Z0_152505","We would like to thank the Swiss National Science Foundation (SCOPES Joint Research Project IZ73Z0_152505) for the financial support provided for the research project discussed in this study.",,,,,,,,,,"Adamides, E., Manolias, I., (2004) Transferring capabilities in international manufacturing operations: The role of the home manufacturing knowledge management practices and attitudes, , https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/wbs/conf/olkc/archive/oklc5/papers/f-2_adamides.pdf, Accessed 10 March 2019; Adenfeldt, M., Lagerström, K., The Development and Sharing of Knowledge by Centres of Excellence and Transnational Teams: A Conceptual Framework (2008) Management International Review, 48 (3), pp. 319-338; Ambos, T.

Research and development (R&D) innovation adoption in agriculture sector is dependent on producers’ willingness to adopt, knowledge capital spillovers, and financial capacity. This research aims to investigate the impact of R&D innovation adoption and climate factors on agriculture TFP growth in Pakistan. The annual time series data were collected from different sources for the period of 1972–2020. For measuring the agriculture TFP, this study adopted the Cobb Douglas and Translog production functions. To analyze the impact of R&D innovation adoption and climate change on agricultural productivity, the dynamic autoregressive distributive lag (ARDL) and two-stage least square (TSLS) approaches were applied for regression analysis. The study outcomes highlight that the agricultural innovation adoption has a significantly positive impact on agriculture TFP growth in Pakistan with weak farmers’ absorptive ability. According to the results, agriculture tractors, innovative seed distribution, and fertilizer consumptions make a significantly positive contribution to agriculture TFP growth. Further, rainfall shows a positive and significant impact on agricultural productivity, where a moderate climate is beneficial for agricultural productivity. The estimation results contain policy suggestions for sustainable R&D adoption and agrarians’ absorptive ability. Based on the obtained results, it has been suggested that producers should focus on R&D innovation adoption to attain higher productivity. The government needs to emphasize innovative technology adoption, specifically to implement the extension services to increase farmers’ education, skills based training, and networking among the farmers to enhance their knowledge capital and absorptive ability. The farmers should also focus on the adoption of climate smart agriculture that can be achieved through the proper utilization of rainwater. For this purpose, the government needs to develop small community dams and large-scale dams for better use of rainwater harvesting. © 2021 by the authors.

In commemoration of this event, we use a bibliometric analysis to present a retrospective on the journal by analyzing its content for the years between 2006 and 2020. We find that the collaboration culture in MIR has risen over time with the increase in the median size of author teams. Moreover, the collaboration network has become more global over time. The methodology used in the journal is predominantly empirical and quantitative with archival data sources most commonly used. The bibliographic coupling of the MIR corpus reveals that the major themes in the journal revolve around “culture,” “emerging economies,” “innovation, knowledge transfer, and absorptive capacity,” “internationalization process,” “culture and entry modes,” and “internationalization and performance.” A comparison with other leading international business journals provides distinct pathways in which MIR may continue to grow. Finally, it is important to note that while the share of conceptual studies has decreased significantly in the last 15 years, the MIR editors want to see more novel and theoretically grounded conceptual articles in the journal. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bibliographic coupling; Bibliometric analysis; Co-authorship analysis; International business; International management",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Acedo, F.J., Barroso, C., Casanueva, C., Galan, J.L., Co-authorship in management and organizational studies: An empirical and network analysis (2006) Journal of Management Studies, 43 (5), pp. 957-983; Akkermans, D., Harzing, A.W., van Witteloostuijn, A., Cultural accommodation and language priming: Competitive versus cooperative behavior in a prisoner’s dilemma game (2010) Management International Review, 50 (5), pp. 559-583; Ambos, B., Mahnke, V., How do MNC headquarters add value?

The authors rely on the adaptation aspect of dynamic capabilities (DC) theory and their analysis shows how and why a factory adapts its resources and capabilities during digital transformation. Design/methodology/approach: To grasp the change, the authors apply the longitudinal case study method within a revelatory case setting. The digital transformation is detailed from the perspective of a subsidiary that has played a key role in the division's digital transformation. Findings: Analysing the revealed four stages of the transformation through the lenses of the DC components of adaptation (sensing capability, absorptive capacity, integrative capability, relational capability), this study suggests a sequence with unbalanced characteristics. Each stage starts with sensing capability, each component appears during each stage and each stage is dominated by a different component. Relying on the path dependency concept, the authors also present that the interplay between lean as an old resource stock and digital manufacturing as a new resource stock is rather a necessity, especially at the beginning of the transformation (at a corporation that pursues lean for years). Practical implications: Digital strategy development is rather an intermediate element of the transformation, since committed personnel (or maybe their network) start bottom-up and coordinate initiatives as they sense the opportunities in the environment. Top managers should rely on their accumulated knowledge and involve them into the transfer coalition in the top-down phase of digitalization. The authors’ case also underlines that starting to experiment with novel technologies requires a solid (and usually expensive) technological and human basis. Finally, process improvement focussed developments at a high-performing factory might be just enough to deal with ever-demanding customer expectations. Originality/value: This study is among the firsts in operations management that relies on the DC theory to follow up the digital transformation of a factory. A further valuable contribution is that the adaptation process is examined in a longitudinal case study. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Automotive industry; Case study; Digitalization; Industry 4.0","Industrial management; Software engineering; Design/methodology/approach; Digital manufacturing; Digital transformation; Integrative capabilities; Longitudinal case study; Operations management; Relational capabilities; Resources and capabilities; Manufacture",,,,,"European Commission, EC; European Social Fund, ESF","This research was supported by the project “Aspects on the development of intelligent, sustainable and inclusive society: social, technological, innovation networks in employment and digital economy” (EFOP-3.6.2-16-2017-00007).

In recent years, Open Innovation (OI) has burst onto the scene as a more open approach, in which the sources and exchange of knowledge are extended beyond organisational borders. One of the main actors and providers of knowledge is the University. The literature related to OI and the University is very prolific, but at the same time dispersed. This paper aims to expand on the trend in research on OI and University. To do this, bibliometric techniques have been used to analyse a sample of 349 articles from journals indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) between 2005 and 2020. The results suggest that there is a high level of interest in research on this subject and that it is in full swing. The focus of the research is on topics such as collaboration, business–industry, R&D, networks, performance or knowledge-transfer. Emerging themes such as knowledge-spillover or absorptive-capacity appear, which are related to the research sensitivity on the true use of the knowledge generated. In recent years, there has been a trend towards research into entrepreneurship, key aspects of R&D such as strategy and cooperation, or education management. With regard to research related to University–Enterprise cooperation, the focus has been on SMEs, Helix models, entrepreneurship, or commercialisation. Finally, there are areas of research that require greater development related to family businesses and SMEs. This work sheds light on the state of the literature related to OI and University and is very useful for the orientation of future work in the field of research. © 2021 by the authors.

It uses data from 212 Canadian KTTOs. When knowledge delivery capacity (KDC) and knowledge integration capacity (KIC) dimensions of knowledge intermediation are simultaneously accounted for, four categories of KTTOs emerge, namely, (1) knowledge stores; (2) knowledge match providers; (3) knowledge integrators; and (4) knowledge brokers. This heterogeneity results in a differentiation in KTTOs' service delivery strategies. Factors that are conducive to custom-made solutions include (i) increased innovativeness; (ii) higher absorptive capacity; (iii) stronger information search and storage capabilities; (iv) effective customer knowledge management (CKM); and (v) increased networking capabilities. Larger knowledge intermediaries suffer from internal organizational stickiness that prevents them from delivering custom-made services. KTTOs with a low degree of formalization and centralization in decision-making are likely to adopt intermediation strategies aimed at reaching the largest possible number of users. Some managerial and public policy implications are drawn. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Associazione ICC.

However, technology absorptive capacity can enhance an individual’s learning behaviour. This study investigates that technology readiness, the tools for knowledge sources, social influences, and social networks influence an individual’s absorptive capacity on an adaptation of the individual learning behaviour. A quantitative approach is used to assess the presence of a causal relationship from the constructs mentioned above. Data were collected from university students in Australia to examine the hypotheses. With 199 responses, a partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) approach was used for the analysis. The results generated mixed findings. Individual’s technological belief in optimism and innovation and social influences had a significantly weaker effect on individual absorptive capacity, which in turn had a significantly weaker impact on their learning behaviour. © 2021 by the authors.

We present a model in which workers acquire knowledge on the job and firms pursue a policy of learning-by-hiring. The latter generates workers flows that connect firms in a network. A firm's position in the network depends on its capacity to absorb the tacit knowledge developed by other firms in the economy. The model predicts that firms central to the network, those with the highest absorptive capacity of tacit knowledge, have the highest wage dispersion. Using 1995-2001 Veneto (a region of Italy) matched employer-employee data, we map workers flows between firms and build the network formed by all the firms. For each firm, we assess its network centrality. In our data conditional within-firm wage dispersion turns out to be increasing in network centrality, confirming the prediction of the model. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Knowledge transfer; Labour mobility, Network; Wage dispersion",,,,,,"Università degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca: 2017-ATE-0185","The authors are grateful to Giuseppe Tattara for providing the Veneto Work History Data.

Network connections provide access to external knowledge in the community; the absorption and transfer of this new knowledge require appropriate internal knowledge and developer roles. With longitudinal data collected from 4,518 open source software development projects hosted at SourceForge, the authors show that knowledge breadth (depth) helps with the absorption of external knowledge achieved from network depth (breadth), but it inhibits the absorption of external knowledge obtained from network breadth (depth). Further, developer roles (e.g., bridge members, role diversity) can mitigate the negative consequences of suboptimal combinations and facilitate effective transfers of absorbed external knowledge across and within projects. These findings provide important theoretical and managerial implications for managing network connections, knowledge, and developer roles in open source software communities. © 2020 University of Minnesota.

This is a bi-directional exchange where the buyer and supply network each act as the sender and receiver of knowledge. Prior research has however largely focused on the knowledge recipient only. We consider both sender and recipient using two key dynamic capabilities related to knowledge transfer: (i) desorptive capacity, which enables the safe transfer of knowledge from the sender; and, (ii) absorptive capacity, which enables the acquisition and assimilation of external knowledge by the recipient. Using the concept of ‘fit’, we investigate whether organisations strengthen supply chain competence when their desorptive capacity exceeds that of their supply network's (positive misfit) and consider the moderating role of the organisation’s and supply network’s absorptive capacity. Multiple regression analysis of survey data from 250 firms identifies an inverted U-shaped relationship between positive desorptive capacity misfit and supply chain competence. Further, this relationship is shown to be moderated by the supply network’s absorptive capacity level. The paper furthers our understanding of supply chain knowledge management enabling buyers and their supply networks to achieve more successful knowledge transfer outcomes. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","absorptive capacity;

Taking into account the transitioning economy context, I further exploit the gradual and spatially uneven implementation of market-oriented reforms to track the relative importance of firms' absorptive capacity for economic catch-up. The three main results are as follows. First, firms exhibit higher productivity when located in an area with a denser network of related activities, particularly for firms with higher absorptive capacity. Second, the sources of the productivity gains are driven by externalities that arise from better access to inputs, similar workers and technological-related knowledge spillovers. Third, the role of absorptive capacity becomes more important for boosting productivity following more versus less intensive market-oriented economic reforms. These findings have important policy implications for transitioning economies and suggest that market reforms promote efficiency improvements related to performing actual R&D as well as encourage firms to seek out external sources of knowledge in order to attain market competitiveness. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Previous studies typically consider direct linkages in order to understand technological advancement without paying much attention to indirect linkages, such as the inter-connectivity of the recipients of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). To understand the relationship between FDI and technological advancement and whether recipients’ absorptive capacity matters, we model global FDI networks for the period 2009–2016. We find empirical evidence that the global FDI network has a core-periphery structure, and that core countries are more technologically developed than peripheral countries. We also find empirical evidence that a country's centrality of position in the global FDI network is positively associated with the technological advancement of a country, and that the absorptive capacity of a country can moderate this relationship. Regression analyses using instrumental variable estimators confirm the robustness of our findings. The most striking finding of our research is the strong moderation effect of knowledge intensity, a constituent of absorptive capacity.

However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying social-media-based customer-firm co-creation and their implications for business value in NPD. To address this knowledge gap, this study develops a model from the perspective of organizational learning and social capital to examine how the social-media-based customer-firm co-creation mechanism conceptualized as the structural, cognitive, and relational dimension of social capital influences the first-order knowledge outcome (knowledge transfer effectiveness) and second-order dynamic capability outcome (absorptive capacity), and how these co-creation outcomes ultimately influence organizational performance. The model is tested using survey data from 149 Chinese mobile application developers. The results indicate that social-media-based structural, cognitive, and relational linkage, in particular the structural linkage, is an important co-creation mechanism to improve organizational performance. Knowledge transfer effectiveness and absorptive capacity have significant mediating effects in this co-creation mechanism-outcomes-performance framework. Further, the moderating effects of social media use level on the relationships between co-creation mechanism and outcomes are largely supported. The study contributes to theory and practice by shedding light on the social-media-based customer-firm co-creation in NPD at a process level. © 2019","Business value; Co-creation; Organizational learning; Organizational performance; Social capital; Social media","Digital storage; Knowledge management; Product development; Sales; Social networking (online); Business value; Co-creation; Organizational learning; Organizational performance; Social capitals; Social media; Economic and social effects",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 71602152","The work described in this paper was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71602152 ).",,,,,,,,,,"Lusch, R.F., Nambisan, S., Service innovation: a service-dominant logic perspective (2015) Mis Q., 39 (1), pp. 155-176; Saldanha, T.J.V., Mithas, S., Krishnan, M.S., Leveraging customer involvement for fueling innovation: the role of relational and analytical information processing capabilities (2017) Mis Q., 41 (1), pp. 267-286; Zhang, H., Lu, Y., Wang, B., Wu, S., The impacts of technological environments and co-creation experiences on customer participation (2015) Inf.

For policy-makers focusing on increasing incumbents’ innovative performance, the systematic reduction of knowledge filter through improved absorptive capacities thus becomes a crucial goal. While the general working mechanisms of knowledge filter have been analyzed within the KSTE framework, few institutional solutions to increase absorptive capacities have been put forth. This study provides an initial case study explaining a specific institutional framework fostering the systematic penetration of knowledge filters by incumbent firms in the case of German SMEs. Using a set of 177 in-depth interviews with firm representatives, the system of interrelated organizations, institutional arrangements, shared values, and economic incentives associated with the institutional structures for knowledge spillovers for German SMEs are described. I identify institutional characteristics connected to the dual system of vocational training, regulatory measures, and economic incentives mutually enforcing and fostering broad knowledge spillovers. This exploratory approach enables deriving hypotheses for the further study of knowledge filters as well as policy implications for the design of institutions increasing incumbents’ absorptive capacities. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Entrepreneurship; Knowledge filter; Knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship; Networks; Small and medium enterprises",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Acs, Z.J., Plummer, L.A., Penetrating the ‘knowledge filter’ in regional economies (2005) The Annals of Regional Science, 39 (3), pp. 439-456; Acs, Z.J., Audretsch, D.B., Braunerhjelm, P., Carlsson, B., (2004) The missing link: the knowledge filter and endogenous growth (discussion paper), , Center, Stockholm; Acs, Z.J., Braunerhjelm, P., Audretsch, D.B., Carlsson, B., The knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship (2009) Small Business Economics, 32 (1), pp. 15-30; Acs, Z.J., Plummer, L.A., Sutter, R., Penetrating the knowledge filter in “rust belt” economies (2009) The Annals of Regional Science, 43 (4), pp. 989-1012; Acs, Z.J., Audretsch, D.B., Lehmann, E.E., The knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship (2013) Small Business Economics, 41 (4), pp. 757-774; Acs, Z.J., Audretsch, D.B., Lehman, E.E., Licht, G., National systems of entrepreneurship (2016) Small Business Economics, 46 (4), pp. 527-535; Akerlof, G.A., The market for “lemons”: quality uncertainty and the market mechanism (1970) The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 84 (3), pp. 488-500; Arrow, K.J., The economic implications of learning by doing (1962) The Review of Economic Studies, 29 (3), pp. 155-173; Audretsch, D.B., (1995) Innovation and industry evolution, , MIT Press, Cambridge; Audretsch, D.B., Caiazza, R., Technology transfer and entrepreneurship: cross-national analysis (2016) Journal of Technology Transfer, 41 (6), pp. 1247-1259; Audretsch, D.B., Keilbach, M., The theory of knowledge spillover entrepreneurship (2007) Journal of Management Studies, 44 (7), pp. 1243-1254; Audretsch, D.B., Keilbach, M., Resolving the knowledge paradox: knowledge-spillover entrepreneurship and economic growth (2008) Research Policy, 37 (10), pp. 1697-1705; Audretsch, D.B., Keilbach, M., Lehmann, E.E., (2006) Entrepreneurship and economic growth, , (eds), Oxford University Press, Oxford; Braunerhjelm, P., Acs, Z.J., Audretsch, D.B., Carlsson, B., The missing link: knowledge diffusion and entrepreneurship in endogenous growth (2010) Small Business Economics, 34 (2), pp. 105-125; Busemeyer, M.R., Schlicht-Schmälzle, R., Partisan power, economic coordination and variations in vocational training systems in Europe (2014) European Journal of Industrial Relations, 20 (1), pp. 55-71; Cappelli, R., Czarnitzki, D., Kraft, K., Sources of spillovers for imitation and innovation (2014) Research Policy, 43 (1), pp. 115-120; Carlsson, B., Acs, Z.J., Audretsch, D.B., Braunerhjelm, P., Knowledge creation, entrepreneurship, and economic growth: a historical review (2009) Industrial and Corporate Change, 18 (6), pp. 1193-1229; Cohen, W.M., Levinthal, D.A., Absorptive capacity: a new perspective on learning and innovation (1990) Administrative Science Quarterly, 35, pp. 128-152; De Massis, A., Audretsch, D., Uhlaner, L., Kammerlander, N., Innovation with limited resources: management lessons from the German Mittelstand (2017) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 35, pp. 125-146; Driffield, N., Love, J.H., Who gains from whom?

Therefore, firms are looking for new ways to innovate as efficiently and quickly as possible, at the lower or same costs. Knowledge is seen as the critical determinant of successful innovation because it could lead to knowledge spillover effects. These occur inside as well as outside the firm boundary, depending on several different factors. These are, for example, the openness of firms, absorptive capacity, firm policy in protecting internal know-how, and many others. Similarly, the acquisition of external technologies was recognized as an essential method to create innovations and achieve higher economic returns. Therefore, in the era of open innovation, the ability of firms to effectively use external resources (knowledge and technology) is crucial, especially in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). These countries have not always been able to benefit from external knowledge sources successfully and thus lag behind other European countries, among other things, in the areas of innovation and competitiveness. It is since CEE countries have faced (in comparison with Western European countries) to several challenges. For example, the worse technological equipment of companies, less advanced research and innovation systems and networks, lower trust, entrepreneurial skills, and spirit, due to the broken entrepreneurial tradition. Therefore, this article aims to analyze the influence of external knowledge and technology acquisition on firms' product and process innovation performance within selected CEE countries. Namely, we focus on the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Poland. For this study, we are using our own binary logistic regression models and data provided by the World Bank-latest available Enterprise Survey 2019. The results of our research will provide several practical implications for firms and public policymakers in selected countries, but also in other CEE countries. © 2020 Academic Conferences Limited.

However, the mechanism is not clear enough, or rather scattered, and thus lacks an integrated model for comprehensive conceptualization. Adopting a sample of 105 Chinese firms, we construct an integrated two-stage model to interpret the mechanism of knowledge transfer from global flagships to local firms and find that global flagships' capacity and willingness to transfer positively impact the knowledge acquired by local firms through the mediation of the knowledge contributed by the global flagships. Organizational distance and local firms' absorptive capacity affect the knowledge acquired by local firms as well. The influences of the latter two also depend on the different types of ties between global flagships and local firms. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.","global flagships; Global production networks; inter/intra-firm ties; knowledge transfer; local firms",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Albino, V, Garavelli, AC, Schiuma, G, Knowledge transfer and inter-firm relationships in industrial districts: The role of the leader firm (1998) Technovation, 19, pp. 53-63; Argote, L, Ingram, P, Levine, JM, Moreland, RL, Knowledge transfer in organizations: Learning from the experience of others (2000) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 82, pp. 1-8; Bettis, RA, Prahalad, CK, The dominant logic: Retrospective and extension (1995) Strategic Management Journal, 16, pp. 5-14; Boh, WF, Nguyen, TT, Xu, Y, Knowledge transfer across dissimilar cultures (2013) Journal of Knowledge Management, 17, pp. 29-46; Chen, C-J, The effects of knowledge attribute, alliance characteristics, and absorptive capacity on knowledge transfer performance (2004) R&D Management, 34, pp. 311-321; Cohen, WM, Levinthal, DA, Absorptive capacity: A new perspective on learning and innovation (1990) Administrative Science Quarterly, 35, pp. 128-152; Cummings, JL, Teng, B-S, Transferring R&D knowledge: The key factors affecting knowledge transfer success (2003) Journal of Engineering and Technology Management, 20, pp. 39-68; Dhanaraj, C, Lyles, MA, Steensma, HK, Tihanyi, L, Managing tacit and explicit knowledge transfer in IJVs: The role of relational embeddedness and the impact on performance (2004) Journal of International Business Studies, 35, pp. 428-442; Ding, X-H, He, Y, Wu, J, Cheng, C, Effects of positive incentive and negative incentive in knowledge transfer: Carrot and Stick (2016) Chinese Management Studies, 10, pp. 593-614; Dougherty, D, Hardy, C, Sustained product innovation in large, mature organizations: Overcoming innovation-to-organization problems (1996) Academy of Management Journal, 39, pp. 1120-1153; Du, J, Ding, S, Phenomenon-driven research on internationalization and innovation by bibliometric and context analyses (2019) Asian Journal of Technology Innovation, 27, pp. 315-337; Du, J, Zhou, C, Does Guanxi matter in the foreign expansion of Chinese manufacturing firms?

MNCs transfer innovations, expertise, knowledge and advanced technologies to their host countries through their subsidiaries. Therefore, multinational companies are seen as transfer intermediaries distributing international technologies and innovations. MNCs help to bridge the existing technology gap between developed and developing countries. Due to the multilocation nature of MNCs, the study aims to examine the various drivers that influence Hungarian MNCs' R&D collaborations, making them choose to collaborate either with local partners or with partners in the countries of their headquarters. The paper reports on the preliminary findings of an on-going comparative research focused on understanding the key drivers of innovations and competitiveness in Hungary. For our empirical analysis, drawing on data from the Eurostat's harmonized Community Innovation Survey 2010-2012, we used the probit regression model. Since many studies have shown that innovation processes in companies are based on the same principles or similar framework, it is possible to generalize the results of the analysed data and successfully put the recommendations into practice. Our analysis provided mixed results; it has demonstrated that marketing orientations, expenditures devoted to research and development, absorptive capacity, firm size as well as funding support provided to Hungarian MNCs influenced their choice of collaborating partners. Hungarian MNCs were highly probable to collaborate with both local and foreign partners in the enterprise group, while preferring to cooperate with local universities rather than foreign ones. © Odei S.

These financial supports can help both MNCs and local partners to overcome the shortage of finances that can be a barrier to the local innovation system. Cross-country analysis has suggested that financial support encourages firms to renew their participation in R&D collaboration to initiate new collaborations [19].

Although the dynamic synergy mechanism of the triple helix relations is essential to technology innovation, there are limited research methodologies to study or estimate the synergy effect accurately. This paper introduces a new approach in non-linear complex systems theory to offer steps towards a possible solution to this conundrum. Based on the pattern formation of the Belousov-Zhabotinsky's reaction, the paper constructs a simulation equation to explore the evolution mechanism by comparing the ideal state with the current state in China. The research finds that (1) under the ideal balanced condition of industrial absorptive capacity and academic knowledge transfer capability, the stronger incentive policies would play much more important roles than weak policies; (2) the performance of collaborative innovation is not optimal under current situation in China, but the industrial absorptive capacity, especially in private enterprises, has exceeded the capability of knowledge transfer in academia, and it has become the main driving force to promote future innovation. If the innovation policy can be focused on the high-level balance between the knowledge network and innovation network to promote synergy in China, the innovation performance will be accelerated more efficiently. © 2019 by the authors.","China; National system of innovation; Synergy mechanism; Triple helix","economic growth; innovation; investment incentive; knowledge based system; national planning; participatory approach; synergism; technological development; China",,,,,"BIA150117; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 71573222; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF: LZ16G030002; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","Funding: This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under the Grant No. 71573222, by the National Education Sciences Planning under the Grant No. BIA150117, by the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang province under the Grant No. LZ16G030002, and by the fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, by the new type key thinking tank of Zhejiang province “Research institute of regulation and public policy”.",,,,,,,,,,"Nelson, R.R., Winter, S.G., (1982) An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change, , Belknap Press of Harvard University Press: Cambridge, MA, USA; David, P.A., Foray, D., An Introduction to the Economy of the Knowledge Society (2001) Int.

Based on patent transaction data among cities during 2005- 2015, this study investigates the interurban technology transfer network of Northeast China, aiming to explore spatial evolution of technology transfer network in this region from national to local perspectives based on social network analysis (SNA). A negative binomial regression analysis further reveals the factors of interurban technology transfer network. The results of the study are as follows: (1) From the national perspective, the interurban technology transfer network of Northeast China presents a core- periphery structure. The spatial pattern of ""divergence in the northeast region"" and ""convergence in the coastal areas"" has been formed. (2) From the local perspective, the technology transfer network of Northeast China shows a centripetal contraction situation, and its four hubs, namely, Harbin, Changchun, Shenyang and Dalian, play the role of technology gatekeeper. The interurban technology transfer flows present the characteristic of strengthening nationalization and weakening localization, which are more likely to emerge between the Northeast-Southeast China rather than among the Northeast China. (3) Both pathdependence and path- creation exist in the spatial dynamics of intercity technology flows in Northeast China. From the national perspective, technology flows from Northeast China to the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta urban agglomerations with Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen as the core respectively, while the local intercity technology transfer in Northeast China presents a mixed diffusing mode including hierarchical, contagious and jump diffusions. In addition, the local network mainly focuses on intra- provincial technology flows which centered on Haibin, Changchun, Shenyang and Dalian. (4) Some drivers, such as geographical proximity, the similarity of industrial structure, economic differences, the similarity of innovation capability, technology absorptive capacity, foreign direct investment, are evidenced to play a significant or determining role in interurban technology transfer of Northeast China. © 2019, Science Press.

Design/methodology/approach: By means of bibliometric citation analysis, ISI Web of Science (WoS) database is used to analyze articles from 1990-2018. A total of 169 articles by 369 authors across 40 countries published in 113 journals from 200 institutions were clustered and examined through HistCites and VOSviewer. Findings: The exploration of KM in franchising is associated with 3 factors: governance structure; performance outcome; and franchise network growth. The findings also reveal that KM in franchising is still an emerging discipline encompassing conflicting results which offer potential for future research. Research limitations/implications: Identified research gaps and contradicting views in the literature offer opportunities for researchers to contribute to this research domain by empirically testing the role of absorptive capacity, replication vs adaptation strategies and new franchising formats, such as micro/social franchising. Originality/value: This study is unique in its examination of KM in franchising.

It pays particular attention to what kind of knowledge a firm obtains and how it can be efficiently used in exploring and exploiting opportunities in international markets. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical basis for the study is a longitudinal case study of knowledge-intensive Estonian companies that collaborate with the European Space Agency (ESA). A rich data set was collected over three years. Findings: By studying the inward and outward activities of the two case companies collaborating with the ESA, the authors found that the internationalisation process of these firms had unique characteristics. Their international expansion was not driven by increasing market knowledge and reducing risk or uncertainty, but by resource seeking for research and development efforts. It was a cyclical, non-linear process, which was advanced by co-creation, learning and exploitation of the emergent knowledge, leading to an improved network position and identification of further opportunities. Research limitations/implications: The focus was on knowledge-intensive, resource-constrained firms and their collaboration with big-science centres. The transfer of the proposed framework to another context may not be straightforward. The authors relied on informants from the firms, thus ignoring the view of their partner, the big-science centre. It may be that because of this perspective, the authors did not capture some aspects of the collaboration. A broader range of cases would have provided more powerful support to the findings. Although the cases were sufficient for theory refinement and building a tentative framework, they also call for further cases that would clarify whether these conclusions would be valid for other companies. Practical implications: Collaboration with big-science centres provides companies with access to diverse types of knowledge. However, its impact on the future success in internationalisation also depends on other factors, such as the firm’s absorptive capacity and technological competence. Social implications: Governments invest substantially on the development of big-science centres with the expectation that they would have significant knowledge spillovers on the technology development. A more qualitative approach to impact assessment opens new ideas how to develop their activities and in particular their collaboration with SMEs. Originality/value: The study reassesses the theory on the internationalisation process of the firm and gives voice to companies which have been marginalised in earlier research. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Big-science centre; Estonia; European Space Agency; Internationalization; Knowledge; Small-to-medium-sized enterprises",,,,,,"FP7 Information and Communication Technologies, ICT; Eesti Teadusagentuur, ETAg: PUT1003","Company A was established in 1989 by an entrepreneurial team aiming to rekindle cartography in Estonia. Since its early days, the company’s product range has continuously expanded from cartography to geographic information systems, to mobile and satellite applications. However, all these business fields are connected to spatial-information usage by different end-user groups. In 1993, the company’s current owner was appointed as the CEO. He recognised the potential of the digitisation of core business processes. By the mid-1990s, the whole process of map production was supported by ICT tools. This step led to entry into a new business field: the development and sale of geographical information systems. By 1998, Company A became the leading software developer in this niche in the domestic market.","This research has been supported by funding from the Estonian Research Council (project PUT1003), which is a government institution supporting scientific research in Estonia.",,,,,,,,,"Åkerman, N., Knowledge-acquisition strategies and the effects on market knowledge – profiling the internationalizing firm (2015) European Management Journal, 33 (2), pp. 79-88; Alvesson, M., Sandberg, J., Generating research questions through problematization (2011) Academy of Management Review, 36 (2), pp. 247-271; Autio, E., Bianchi-Streit, M., Hameri, A.-P., (2003) Technology Transfer and Technological Learning Through CERN’s Procurement Activity, , CERN-2003-005, CERN, Geneva; Autio, E., Hameri, A.-P., Vuola, O., A framework of industrial knowledge spillovers in big-science centers (2004) Research Policy, 33 (1), pp. 107-126; Autio, E., Sapienza, H.J., Almeida, J.G., Effects of age at entry, knowledge intensity, and imitability on international growth (2000) Academy of Management Journal, 43 (5), pp. 909-924; Bach, L., Cohendet, P., Schenk, É., Technological transfers from the European space programs: a dynamic view and comparison with other R&D projects (2002) Journal of Technology Transfer, 27 (4), pp. 321-338; Baker, T., Nelson, R.E., Creating something from nothing: resource construction through entrepreneurial bricolage (2005) Administrative Science Quarterly, 50 (3), pp. 329-366; Bazeley, P., (2007) Qualitative Data Analysis with NVivo, , Sage Publications, London; Blomstermo, A., Eriksson, K., Lindstrand, A., Sharma, D.D., The perceived usefulness of network experiential knowledge in the internationalizing firm (2004) Journal of International Management, 10 (3), pp. 355-373; Bruneel, J., Yli-Renko, H., Clarysse, B., Learning from experience and learning from others: how congenital and interorganizational learning substitute for experiential learning in young firm internationalization (2010) Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, 4 (2), pp. 164-182; Byckling, E., Hameri, A.-P., Pettersson, T., Wenninger, H., Spin-offs from CERN and the case of TuoviWDM (2000) Technovation, 20 (2), pp. 71-80; Cavusgil, S.T., Knight, G., The born global firm: an entrepreneurial and capabilities perspective on early and rapid internationalization (2015) Journal of International Business Studies, 46 (1), pp. 3-16; Chiva, R., Ghauri, P., Alegre, J., Organizational learning, innovation and internationalization: a complex system model (2014) British Journal of Management, 25 (4), pp. 687-705; Clarysse, B., Wright, M., Mustar, P., Behavioural additionality of R&D subsidies: a learning perspective (2009) Research Policy, 38 (10), pp. 1517-1533; Cohen, W.M., Levinthal, D.A., Absorptive capacity: a new perspective on learning and innovation (1990) Administrative Science Quarterly, 35 (1), pp. 128-152; Cohendet, P., Evaluating the industrial indirect effects of technology programmes: the case of the European Space Agency (ESA) programmes (1997) Proceedings of the OECD Conference on Policy Evaluation in Innovation and Technology, BETA, Université Louis Pasteur, pp. 189-223. , Strasbourg; Corley, K.G., Gioia, D.A., Building theory about theory building: what constitutes a theoretical contribution?

Empirical results from a sample of SMEs in Saxon-Czech borderland (SMEs; N = 263) – mainly belonging to the manufacturing sector – show, that i.e. willingness to collaborate, corporate innovation culture, enterprise’s absorptive capacity, positively perceived regional cooperation climate, adequate funding opportunities for collaboration and regional availability of qualified staff are factors contributing significantly to emergence of cross-border collaboration between firms and research organisations. 2nd sub-study investigated how collaboration between SMEs and research organisations proceeds. Main result of a qualitative study (N = 89) is a model of social roles describing tasks which are necessary for successful collaboration processes.

We start from the widely accepted view that distant, externally-developed knowledge is difficult to absorb into the focal firm's own knowledge production. We suggest that high levels of intrafirm inventor task network diversity and task network density are essential for a diversity of knowledge inputs and coordinated actions regarding knowledge transfer, which in turn, reduces problems related to the absorption of knowledge—especially in the case of knowledge that is distant from the focal firm. The results of an event history study of 113 pharmaceutical firms that engaged in technology in-licensing from 1986 to 2003 provide general support for our hypotheses. Managerial Summary: Firms keen to keep up with an uncertain and ever-changing industry environment, can benefit from the speedy introduction of inventions. We examine how firms absorb licensed-in technologies to nurture the rapid development of own related inventions. We show that a firm's absorption speed depends on the characteristics of the internal collaboration networks among the firm's inventor employees. More specifically, technologically diverse and well-connected inventor networks improve the firm's ability to absorb external technologies quickly. This applies especially to externally acquired technologies that are unfamiliar to the firm. Depending on the distance of the acquired technology from the focal firm combined with speed-inducing inventor network characteristics, our estimates suggest that firms can reduce the time needed for absorption by several months.

We make four main contributions to the existing literature. First, our characterisation of knowledge context provides the basis for a more specific identification of which elements of firms’ knowledge environment are important for innovation, discriminating between spatial, sectoral and network influences. Second, we reflect the role of innovation ambition in shaping firms’ knowledge search strategies. Third, we differentiate between firms’ interactive and non-interactive knowledge search activities and recognise that these may be complemented by unanticipated and serendipitous knowledge spillovers. Finally, we employ the notion of encoding capacity to reflect firms’ internal ability to assimilate and apply external knowledge, and clarify its distinctiveness from the more general concept of absorptive capacity. Our framework provides an integrating mechanism for existing empirical studies, and suggests a number of new research directions related to the determinants of innovation performance and the heterogeneity of innovation outcomes. © 2017 The Author(s).

Primary data were collected from export consortia in Tunisia through a questionnaire survey. The research underlines the impact of the strength and the range of ties between managers. It is also found that managers' absorptive capacity moderates the impact of the strength of ties. This study considers the individual's behavior at the heart of the knowledge transfer process and suggests a substitution effect between the strength of social ties and individual's absorptive capacity.

As well as physical strength and driving technique, skills to adjust equipment are critical for racers to win a race. Based on the contingency theory of social capital, this study analysed comprehensive panel data of motorboat racers and revealed that bonding and bridging social capital had different impacts on performance according to life cycle stages of racers and changes in regulation. First, bonding social capital has a positive impact on performance when racers are less experienced and most need psychological aid stemming from strong ties. Second, bridging social capital has a positive impact on performance when racers are more experienced and have accumulated absorptive capacity to learn efficiently from diverse sources of knowledge. Third, both bonding and bridging social capital lose their explanatory power after the changes in regulation that shifted ownership of propellers from racers to the authority, which could mitigate the significance of the formation of small groups among racers to share cost and knowledge regarding the improvement in propellers. Research and managerial implications of the findings are discussed. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","contingency theory; Japan; knowledge spillovers; motorboat racing; panel data; performance analysis; public gambling; Social capital; social networks; sports","knowledge; life cycle analysis; panel data; psychology; regulatory framework; research; social capital; social network; spillover effect; sport; Japan; Coluber",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abell, P., Crouchley, R., Mills, C., Social Capital and Entrepreneurship in Great Britain (2001) Enterprise and Innovation Management Studies, 2 (2), pp. 119-144; Ahuja, G., Collaboration Networks, Structural Holes and Innovation: A Longitudinal Study (2000) Administrative Science Quarterly, 45 (3), pp. 425-455; Anand, B., Khanna, T., Do Firms Learn to Create Value?

While we acknowledge the role played by the adoption of a common corporate language, we argue that this response alone is insufficient to cope with the diverse foreign language demands that accompany global expansion. MNEs need what we conceptualize as language operative capacity (LOC): language resources that have been assembled and deployed in a context-relevant and timely manner throughout the MNE’s global network. Language resources are mainly derived from human and social capital, and their interaction, to form what is termed language capital. Managerial motivation and a preparedness to act are necessary to ensure that language capital is converted into LOC. Our theoretical explanation of LOC derivation is multilevel, incorporating two interacting processes: individuals develop, maintain, and contribute their own foreign language resources, but the MNE also plays a key role. It can influence individual behavior and, at the organizational level, provide its own language resources through the provision of computerized translation software and the like. The interaction between these two processes is seen to be critical in the formation and use of LOC. This multilevel explanation contributes to the growing body of literature that considers how human capital resources in general can be converted for productive purposes. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","absorptive capacity; human capital; knowledge transfer; language operative capacity; multinational enterprise; social capital",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adler, P.S., Kwon, S.-W., Social capital: Prospects for a new concept (2002) Academy of Management Review, 27, pp. 17-40; Barner-Rasmussen, W., Björkman, I., Language fluency, socialization and inter-unit relationships in Chinese and Finnish subsidiaries (2007) Management and Organization Review, 3, pp. 105-128; Barrios, S., Benito-Ostolaza, J.M., (2008) The location decisions of multinationals and the cultural link: Evidence from Spanish direct investment abroad, , Departamento de Economía, Universidad Pública de Navarra, Spain,.

Many factors in the social network affect the knowledge transfer activities. Moreover, the effectiveness of knowledge transfer determines the performance of collaborative innovation. From the point of view of relevance between collaborative innovation behavior and social network, this paper analyzes the influence of some factors in social network on knowledge transfer of school enterprise synergy innovation. The purpose of this paper is to find out the laws of knowledge transfer in the process of University-Industry (U-I) collaborative innovation, and to verify the role of these laws through system dynamics simulation. Firstly, this paper summarizes the previous views on collaborative innovation and U-I knowledge transfer. Based on the analysis of literature, it puts forward the process model of knowledge transfer in U-I Collaborative Innovation and analyzes the factors that affect this process. Secondly, the paper uses a system dynamics method to analyze the causality of knowledge transfer in the process of U-I collaborative innovation, establishes the model of system flow diagrams, and uses Vensim PLE to test the validation and sensitivity of the model. Furthermore, the experimental results demonstrate that the model could fit well the actual knowledge transfer activities in the process of U-I collaborative innovation. And, the results show that some factors in social networks (trust, knowledge transfer capability, knowledge absorptive capacity, and contract mechanisms) affect U-I knowledge transfer in different degrees. Finally, some suggestions concerning the promotion of knowledge transfer are presented according to the simulation. © 2018 Taiwan Academic Network Management Committee.

Yet, there is still only limited evidence about individual and institutional best practices for fostering the use of scientific evidence in policy-making processes The present project is the first national-level attempt to (1) map and structurally analyze-quantitatively-health-relevant policy-making networks that connect evidence production, synthesis, interpretation, and use; (2) qualitatively investigate the interaction patterns of a subsample of actors with high centrality metrics within these networks to develop an in-depth understanding of evidence circulation processes; and (3) combine these findings in order to assess a policy network's ""absorptive capacity"" regarding scientific evidence and integrate them into a conceptually sound and empirically grounded framework. Methods: The project is divided into two research components. The first component is based on quantitative analysis of ties (relationships) that link nodes (participants) in a network. Network data will be collected through a multi-step snowball sampling strategy. Data will be analyzed structurally using social network mapping and analysis methods. The second component is based on qualitative interviews with a subsample of the Web survey participants having central, bridging, or atypical positions in the network. Interviews will focus on the process through which evidence circulates and enters practice. Results from both components will then be integrated through an assessment of the network's and subnetwork's effectiveness in identifying, capturing, interpreting, sharing, reframing, and recodifying scientific evidence in policy-making processes. Discussion: Knowledge developed from this project has the potential both to strengthen the scientific understanding of how policy-level knowledge transfer and exchange functions and to provide significantly improved advice on how to ensure evidence plays a more prominent role in public policies. © 2017 The Author(s).","Health-relevant policies; Heath policy; Knowledge exchange; Policy-making; Social network analysis","adult; Canada; human; interview; management; public policy; quantitative analysis; sampling; social network; sound; structure analysis; synthesis; Canada; health care planning; health care policy; medical information system; procedures; Canada; Health Information Exchange; Health Plan Implementation; Health Policy; Humans; Policy Making",,,,,"Canadian Institutes of Health Research, CIHR: 376601","Based on this proposal, the project was awarded a 1-year bridge funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research to run a pilot of the data collection approach (application no. 376601).",,,,,,,,,,"Fisher, E.S., Bynum, J.P., Skinner, J.S., Slowing the growth of health care costs-lessons from regional variation (2009) N Engl J Med, 360 (9), pp. 849-852; Haines, A., Kuruvilla, S., Borchert, M., Bridging the implementation gap between knowledge and action for health (2004) Bull World Health Organ, 82 (10), pp. 724-732; Prewitt, K., Schwandt, T.A., Miron, L., Straf: using science as evidence in public policy.

Having an OS that is compatible with Iranian security applications and requirements is imperative. The first attempt to create local operating system in Iran was made some 10 years ago, when pertinent technological research led to the development of Xamin as Iran's localized operating system. When the first version of the Xamin localized operating system was introduced in the market, some 250 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as 5 large organizations adopted the national operating system. This study analyzes the process of acceptance of Xamin localized open source server operating system technology in Iran. A technology acceptance model (TAM) has been used as the base model, and external variables have been determined based on surveying method. Moreover, two moderator variables have been introduced as new contributors in this study. The results are extracted using path analysis based on structural equation modeling. The statistical population is 250 Xamin users. Data collection tools consist of 200 questionnaires filled out by these users. The results show that subjective norm component and absorptive capacity moderator are two factors affecting the acceptance of this technology. Eventually, given Iran's special conditions, recommendations have been provided for strategic planning or policymaking for acceptance of Xamin operating system. The research also improves knowledge of conceptualization and policymaking for acceptance of high-tech software products. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Moderator; SEM; TAM; Technology acceptance; Xamin","Data transfer; Moderators; Network security; Open source software; Population statistics; Regression analysis; Scanning electron microscopy; Surveys; Data collection tools; Operating system technology; Small and medium-sized enterprise; Structural equation modeling; Technological researches; Technology acceptance; Technology acceptance model; Xamin; Open systems; numerical model; path analysis; scanning electron microscopy; software; technological development; technology adoption; Iran",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adams, D.A., Nelson, R.R., Todd, P.A., Perceived usefulness, ease of use, and usage of information technology: a replication (1992) MIS Q., 16 (2), pp. 224-227; Agarwal, R., Prasad, J., A conceptual and operational definition of personal innovativeness in the domain of information technology (1998) Inf.

By incorporating four different facets (i.e., absorption, sharing, implanting, and application of market knowledge) of the phenomenon, we draw new insights into RKT. Through empirically testing the phenomenon in the Korean context, we reveal that market knowledge absorption by subsidiaries is a critical component that influences the knowledge integration mechanisms (KIMs) within MNC networks. Furthermore, KIMs within MNC networks are primary keys for absorptive capacity (AC) of HQs and knowledge relevance between HQs and subsidiaries. Our results extend our understanding of RKT, while also offering useful implications for MNCs that intend to establish subsidiaries in foreign markets. Copyright © 2016 ASAC.

In doing so, it extends work on retail internationalisation by focusing on the importation, rather than the exportation of business models. The three firms – Coles, Myer and Woolworths – exhibited differing degrees of absorptive capacity in identifying and commercialising knowledge flows. This was reflected in fluctuating levels of success, the scope of store networks and relative positioning in the Australian market. Further, the role played by informal associations between managers in non-competing firms in different markets during the development of discount department stores in Australia advances the case for socialising analyses of business knowledge transfer more broadly. © 2016 Economic History Society of Australia and New Zealand and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","absorptive capacity;

However, facts show fewer types of knowledge transfer practices adopted in the developing countries. Materials and Methods: For making empirical evidence available about knowledge transfer practices, this article makes assessment of the transfer practices of academic research of the PhD faculty members of universities offering degrees in field of Environment in Sindh Pakistan. The identified 28 practices of academic knowledge transfer have been grouped together based on their characteristics by making 7 clusters as, publications, networking, mobility of researchers, joint research, intellectual property and co-operations including spin-off companies and sharing of equipment. At the end, comparison between clusters of knowledge transfer practices is presented. Results: According to research findings, publications in terms of research papers in journal, networking and co-operations are found to be common practices of academic knowledge transfer. However, less number of academic knowledge has been transferred through other practices of knowledge transfer such as, Intellectual Property and joint research programs. Conclusion: This article contributes empirical results of academic knowledge transfer practices in universities in field of environment, with some particular policy implications such as, to enhance the production of professional publication, improvement of alumni organizations, industry people engagement in the academic events, enhancement of absorptive capacity of highly qualified graduates, structuring policies and infrastructure to support the commercialization of academic knowledge, favor of academic work in co-operation and development of mechanisms and infrastructure for development of university spin-offs and development of efficient TTOs. © 2017 Jagul Huma Lashari et al.","Academic research; Environment; Knowledge transfer",,,,,,"Higher Education Commision, Pakistan, HEC","Contract research for the industry without funding by industry","Joint research and development projects with the industry funded by higher education commission of Pakistan",,,,,,,,,"Agrawal, A.K., University-to-industry knowledge transfer: Literature review and unanswered questions (2001) Int.

A framework with type of knowledge, absorptive capacity, disseminative capacity and tie strength is proposed. The framework is verified qualitatively and then further developed by adding another capacity needed by the headquarters: heeding capacity. Design/methodology/approach: To check the validity of the proposed conceptual framework empirically, interview-based qualitative studies were conducted for two partner programs implemented in the Japanese subsidiary of a US-based IT company. Interviews were undertaken with 17 respondents in the headquarters, the Japanese subsidiary and two alliance partners in Japan. Findings: It is confirmed that type of knowledge and absorptive capacity clearly affect the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. Also, it is found that the knowledge sender’s disseminative capacity matters. Additionally, a case is found in which network ties mitigate the ineffectiveness caused by low disseminative/absorptive capacity. Research limitations/implications: In this research, cultural influences have not been considered. Also, this research has not paid attention to inter-organizational knowledge transfer. These provides potential for further research which could explore this complexity in more depth. Practical implications: It is suggested that the headquarters of a MNC need to have a “heeding capacity” in cases where the target subsidiary’s disseminative capacity is low and tie strength between the subsidiary and the headquarters is weak. It is a capacity for the headquarters to heed what a subsidiary would like to transmit but cannot do well, and this is achieved by listening carefully and not letting language barriers or cultural differences obfuscate the meaning. Originality/value: By focusing on a dyad between the headquarters and the Japanese subsidiary, the importance of disseminative capacity of a subsidiary is highlighted, which is not often the case in the extant literature. Also, headquarters’ heeding capacity is proposed. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Absorptive capacity; Disseminative capacity; Heeding capacity; Knowledge transfer; MNC; Tie strength",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ambos, T.C., Ambos, B., Schlegelmilch, B.B., Learning from foreign subsidiaries: an empirical investigation of headquarters’ benefits from reverse knowledge transfers (2006) International Business Review, 15 (3), pp. 294-312; Bhagat, R.S., Kedia, B.L., Harveston, P.D., Triandis, H.C., Cultural variations in the cross-border transfer of organizational knowledge: an integrative framework (2002) The Academy of Management Review, 27 (2), pp. 204-221; Björkman, I., Stahl, G.K., Vaara, E., Cultural differences and capability transfer in cross-border acquisitions: the mediating roles of capability complementarity, absorptive capacity, and social integration (2007) Journal of International Business Studies, 38 (1), pp. 658-672; Brislin, R.W., Back-translation for cross-cultural research (1970) Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 1, pp. 185-216; Brockmann, E.N., Anthony, W.P., The influence of tacit knowledge and collective mind on strategic planning (1998) Journal of Managerial Issues, 10 (2), pp. 204-222; Buckley, P.J., Carter, M.J., Managing cross-border complementary knowledge: conceptual developments in the business process approach to knowledge management in multinational firms (1999) International Studies of Management & Organization, 29 (1), pp. 80-104; Cohen, W.M., Levinthal, D.A., Absorptive capacity: a new perspective on learning and innovation (1990) Administrative Science Quarterly, 35 (1), pp. 128-152; Crouch, M., Mckenzie, H., The logic of small samples in interview-based qualitative research (2006) Social Science Information, 45 (4), pp. 483-499; Davenport, T.H., Prusak, L., (1998) Working Knowledge: How Organizations Manage What They Know, , Harvard Business School Press, Boston, MA; Dyer, J.H., Singh, H., The relational view: cooperative strategy and sources of interorganizational competitive advantage (1998) Academy of Management Review, 23 (4), pp. 660-679; Easterby-Smith, M., Lyles, M.A., Tsang, E.W.K., Inter-organizational knowledge transfer: current themes and future prospects (2008) Journal of Management Studies, 45 (4), pp. 677-690; Granovetter, M., Economic action and social structure: the problem of embeddedness (1985) American Journal of Sociology, 91 (3), pp. 481-510; Grant, R.M., Prospering in dynamically-competitive environments: organizational capability as knowledge integration (1996) Organization Science, 7, pp. 375-387; Gupta, A.K., Govindarajan, V., Knowledge flows and the structure of control within multinational corporations (1991) Academy of Management Review, 16 (4), pp. 768-792; Gupta, A.K., Govindarajan, V., Organizing for knowledge flows within MNCs (1994) International Business Review, 3, pp. 443-457; Hansen, M.T., The search-transfer problem: the role of weak ties in sharing knowledge across organization subunits (1999) Administrative Science Quarterly, 44 (1), pp. 82-111; Harryson, S.J., Dudkowski, R., Stern, A., Transformation networks in innovation alliances – the development of Volvo C70 (2008) Journal of Management Studies, 45 (4), pp. 745-773; Hedlund, G., The role of foreign subsidiaries in strategic decision-making in swedish multinational corporations (1980) Strategic Management Journal, 1, pp. 23-36; Hofstede, G., (1984) Culture’s Consequences: International Differences in Work-Related Values (Cross Cultural Research and Methodology, , Sage Publications, Newbury Park, CA; Inkpen, A.C., Tsang, E.W.K., Social capital, networks, and knowledge transfer (2005) Academy of Management Review, 30 (1), pp. 146-165; Jensen, R., Szulanski, G., Stickiness and the adaptation of organizational practices in cross-border knowledge transfers (2004) Journal of International Business Studies, 35 (6), pp. 508-523; King, N., Template analysis (1998) Qualitative Methods and Analysis in Organizational Research: A Practical Guide, , Symon, G. and Cassell, C (Eds), Sage Publications, Thousand Oaks, CA; Kogut, B., Zander, U., Knowledge of the firm, combinative capabilities, and the replication of technology (1992) Organization Science, 3, pp. 383-397; Kogut, B., Zander, U., Knowledge of the firm and the evolutionary theory of the multinational corporation (1993) Journal of International Business Studies, 24 (4), pp. 625-645; Kogut, B., Zander, U., What firms do?

Design/methodology/approach – Subsidiary-level information is gathered using the sixth round of the International Manufacturing Strategy Survey, thus including 507 subsidiaries from 22 countries. Country context is operationalised using the Global Competitiveness Report published by the World Economic Forum. Findings – The findings reveal that internal integration has a positive influence on operational performance improvement. Country context acts as a moderator on this relationship: subsidiaries in less developed countries are only able to improve their effectiveness (quality, flexibility, delivery), while developed country subsidiaries gain both effectiveness and efficiency (cost, time) benefits from internal integration. Research limitations/implications – The unit of analysis is the knowledge-receiving subsidiary without taking the characteristics of the sending unit or that of the whole network of subsidiaries into account. Based on the context-dependency of the integration-performance relationship found in this paper, a future research agenda is proposed including further factors (absorptive capacity, knowledge complementarity, organisational practices) that could influence this relationship. Practical implications – Subsidiary managers in less developed countries should strive to acquire intra-network knowledge related to effectiveness, while managers in developed countries can expect both efficiency and effectiveness benefits. Originality/value – A large-scale survey encompassing subsidiaries from both emerging and developed countries is used to offer deeper insight into the relationship between internal integration and performance. The paper provides a possible explanation for previous mixed findings on this relationship.

These pressures can also lead to adoption of innovative technologies. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is perceived as a sophisticated technology and diffuses across the cluster by its innovative characteristics. However, firms in the industrial cluster will have different rate of adoption of technologies due to the varying level of knowledge spillover and a heterogeneous absorptive capacity. This study empirically tests how absorptive capacity mediates the institutional forces and the perceived innovation characteristics towards the ERP adoption in an industrial cluster. Mediation effect and the model validity are tested using SEM technique. The results show that absorptive capacity complements the forces of institutional pressure and the perceived innovation characteristics on ERP adoption. The implications of managing the absorptive capacity for better ERP adoption are discussed. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.","absorptive capacity; Cluster institutional isomorphic pressures; ERP adoption; industrial cluster; perceived innovation characteristics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agarwal, R., Prasad, J., The role of perceived innovation characteristics and perceived voluntariness in the adoption of information technologies (1997) Decision Sciences, 28 (3), pp. 557-582; Arthur, B., Silicon valley locational clusters: When do increasing returns imply monopoly?

A concept that is closely linked to IA is absorptive capacity, which is defined as the ability to exploit knowledge that is embodied in IA. The main objective of this paper is to explore what is meant by absorptive capacity, before examining the empirical relationship between absorptive capacity and various dimensions of firm performance. The latter is not straightforward because there is no agreed approach to measuring absorptive capacity. The approach taken here is to use data on whether firms sourced knowledge or collaborated externally from the UK Community Innovation Survey. This allows us to show that there is a clear and important link between absorptive capacity and various dimensions of firm performance. In this paper, we aim to contribute to the special issue by focusing on the role mobilising knowledge can play in improving the performance of firms in the private sector, which has a particular resonance in these difficult economic times. Our central message is that for firms to perform better in hard times, they need to mobilise their absorptive capacity. Government must therefore consider whether they should focus their efforts on helping firms directly to increase their own absorptive capacity or on improving the flow of (local) knowledge through supporting networks. Our view is that, while maintaining existing policies that aim to increase connections and encourage collaborations between firms, there should be a greater emphasis on the firm because evidence shows that unless firms have sufficient absorptive capacity, they will not be able to fully internalise the benefits of any knowledge spillovers, no matter how large such spillovers may potentially be. © 2015 Academy of Social Sciences.

Design/methodology/approach – The research draws on review of industry and academic literature, two online surveys and interviews, overall encompassed by a interpretative exploratory research methodology strategy. Findings – The study supports the interest and potential for developing new products that combine digital music and casual digital games and that draw on firms from more than one region, while potentially involving a wide set of social network key stakeholders. Research limitations/implications – This is an exploratory study in which findings should be challenged by confirmatory studies, including new product design and development of modeling techniques and network-based innovation approaches. This research contributes for the generation of new insights over technological and social driving forces, as well as emerging trends that shed light on the global competitiveness and on convergence of mobile gaming and digital music industries at regional innovation systems view. It also discusses spillover mechanisms based on new knowledge creation, knowledge diffusion and knowledge appropriation throughout the key stakeholders. The customer-centric innovation and network value autocorrelation hypothesis was validated, and both technology convergence and social factors are enhancement factors for innovation. Limitations and further research with larger sampling, specialization techniques and empirical modeling to in-depth analysis is suggested. Practical implications – The study provides a framework for managers to develop new products that merges boundaries of related industries and encourages network-based innovation and cooperation between industry players, involving different regions. Ultimately, it shows opportunities of diversification, by introducing new products into new markets, as result of interdependence, soft factors, knowledge spillover and absorptive capacity mechanisms over a network of key stakeholders across different regions throughout customer-centric innovation, while impacting also new discussion on entrepreneurship and knowledge spillover theory and policy making. Social implications – Social capital network is key for innovation and knowledge spillover among industry players. Content creation regarding products and services show high dependence on spatial external cultural influences, tastes and habits for customer-centric innovation, while impacting on social and learning customer experience, as well. Originality/value – The paper has value for product development and innovation managers, researchers and practitioners. It discusses the value of innovation systems that are purposively developed beyond traditional geographic and industry boundaries. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Casual gaming; Customer focused design; Digital music; Network-based innovation; New product development; Regional innovation systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Acs, Z.J., Audretsch, D.B., (2003) Innovation and Technological Change, , Springer, New York, NY; Arrow, K.J., Nelson, R.R., Economic welfare and the allocation of resources for invention (1962) The Rate and Direction of Inventive Activity, pp. 609-626. , in(Ed.)

The networks emerge as a result of dynamic cooperation between firms occupying different locations in the knowledge space. Partner selection is driven by absorptive capacity which is itself influenced by cognitive distance and R&D investment allocation. Under different knowledge regimes, we examine the structure of networks that emerge and how firms perform within such networks. We find networks that exhibit small world properties which are generally robust to changes in the knowledge regime. Certain network strategies such as occupying brokerage positions or maximising accessibility to potential partners pay off, especially in 'young' industries with limited involuntary but abundant voluntary spillovers. This particular result is driven by endogenous absorptive capacity. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Absorptive capacity; Agent-based modeling; Cognitive distance; Innovation; Knowledge spillovers; Networks",,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG: RTG 1411; Université de Strasbourg; Helmholtz Association: HIRG-0069","Both authors acknowledge financial support from the German Science Foundation ( DFG RTG 1411 ).

The aim of this article is to improve the understanding of the KT phenomena in an open innovation context where multiple diverse quadruple helix stakeholders are interacting. An absorptive capacity-based conceptual framework is proposed, using a priori constructs which portrays the multidimensional process of KT between universities and its constituent stakeholders in pursuit of open innovation and commercialisation. Given the lack of overarching theory in the field, an exploratory, inductive theory building methodology was adopted using semi-structured interviews, document analysis and longitudinal observation data over a three-year period. The findings identify five factors, namely human centric factors, organisational factors, knowledge characteristics, power relationships and network characteristics, which mediate both the ability of stakeholders to engage in KT and the effectiveness of knowledge acquisition, assimilation, transformation and exploitation. This research has implications for policy makers and practitioners by identifying the need to implement interventions to overcome the barriers to KT effectiveness between regional quadruple helix stakeholders within an open innovation ecosystem. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alexander, A.T., Pearsons, S.R., Fielding, S.N., Bessant, J.R., The open innovation era.

However, differences in firms' capabilities to use this newly available knowledge could create a new ""digital divide"" instead. Using 50,013 firm observations covering 117 developing and emerging countries over the 2006-11 period, this paper tests for knowledge spillover effects from industries' adoption of the Internet on firms' productivity and innovation performance. We test for heterogeneous spillover impacts on groups of firms that are commonly less engaged in innovation and on firms with different productivity levels. Our specification regresses firm productivity and innovation performance - i.e., their investment in equipment and ownership of quality certificates and patents - on industries' use of the Internet. Spillover effects are identified by controlling for firms' own investment in Internet technology, industry and country-year fixed effects as well as extensive firm-level controls. Our results show that industries' use of the Internet positively affects the average firm's productivity and its investment in equipment. We also identify modest impacts of industries' use of the Internet on the likelihood that firms obtain quality certificates and patents. On average, we find that the returns to productivity are larger for firms that commonly engage less in innovation, including single-plant establishments, non-exporters, and firms located in small agglomerations. However, results from quantile regressions show that only the most productive firms reap productivity gains from Internet-enabled knowledge access. Firms with productivity levels below the 50th percentile do not benefit much. The spillover effects from industries' adoption of the Internet identified in our work justify public policies aimed at fostering industries' use of the Internet. However, since we show that only firms with adequate absorptive capabilities benefit from the widespread Internet adoption, policy support should also focus on facilitating firms' access to networks and strengthening their capacities to use them. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Firm heterogeneities; Information and communication technology (ICT); Innovation; Internet; Knowledge spillovers; Productivity","developing world; industrial development; industrial policy; information and communication technology; innovation; Internet; knowledge; spillover effect",,,,,"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF","The authors would like to thank Richard Baldwin, Nicolas Berman, Ana Margarida Fernandes, Dominique Guellec, Eric J.

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative research design operationalised via case studies was followed for the empirical analysis. Data collection was developed through in-depth interviews with managing directors in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) belonging to the metal and engineering industry and the textile and footwear sectors in the two old industrial regions. Data analysis followed the techniques of data categorisation, within case-analysis and cross-case analysis. Findings: The study identifies relational capabilities that firms use to identify, access and leverage new knowledge: frequent meetings with customers; frequent meetings with suppliers; dialogue with government to influence policy that encourages research and technology transfer; partnership actions for the commercialisation of products and services; active membership with sector associations; immersion in science and technological parks; intentionally establishing links with entrepreneurship-supporting entities; human resources development by technical training institutions; and systematic links with the University. The relational capabilities identified require structured communication processes and alliance management practices to enable and support absorptive capacity and learning in inter-organisational networks. Practical implications: The relational capabilities identified can help position regions in specific markets and value chains, contribute to improving regions’ internal and external connections and assist in combining regions’ strengths to create industrial capability in high-growth-potential areas. Originality/value: This paper highlights the role of relational capabilities as a way to secure access to knowledge and competencies needed for firms’ innovation and avoidance of competency traps. This is particularly relevant in the context of European smart specialisation policy, where key regional stakeholders collectively engage in the identification of areas of competitive strength, enhanced coordination and strategic alignment of resources. The study is not without limitations, as findings are based on case studies of SMEs operating in the manufacturing industry and the analysis of relational capabilities is focused on knowledge novelty. © 2016, © Jorge Tiago Martins.","Absorptive capacity; Industrial rejuvenation; Knowledge management; Old industrial regions; Relational capabilities",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Asheim, B.T., Gertler, M.S., The geography of innovation: regional innovation systems (2005) The Oxford Handbook of Innovation, pp. 291-317. , Fagerberg, J., Mowery, D. and Nelson, R.and (Eds), Oxford University Press, Oxford; Asheim, B., Smith, H.L., Oughton, C., Regional innovation systems: theory, empirics and policy (2011) Regional Studies, 45 (7), pp. 875-891; Awang, A.H., Yusof Hussain, M., Abdul Malek, J., Knowledge transfer and the role of local absorptive capability at science and technology parks (2013) The Learning Organization, 20 (4-5), pp. 291-307; Bathelt, H., Malmberg, A., Maskell, P., Clusters and knowledge: local buzz, global pipelines and the process of knowledge creation (2004) Progress in Human Geography, 28, pp. 31-56; Bernard, H.R., Ryan, G.W., (2010) Analyzing Qualitative Data: Systematic Approaches, , Sage Publications, Thousand Oaks, CA; Birch, K., MacKinnon, D., Cumbers, A., Old industrial regions in Europe: a comparative assessment of economic performance (2010) Regional Studies, 44 (1), pp. 35-53; Bojica, A.M., Estrada, I., In good company: how and when SMEs benefit from a relationship with a key strategic partner (2014) Academy of Management Proceedings; Camagni, R., (1991) Innovation Networks: Spatial Perspectives, , Belhaven Press, London; Camagni, R., Innovative milieu and European lagging regions (1995) Regional Science, 74 (4), pp. 317-340; Camagni, R., Capello, R., Milieux innovators and collective learning: from concepts to measurement (2002) The Emergence of the Knowledge Economy: A Regional Perspective, , Acs, Z., de Groot, H. and Nijkamp, P.and (Eds), Springer-Verlag, Berlin; Capaldo, A., Network structure innovation: the leveraging of a dual network as a distinctive relational capability (2007) Strategic Management Journal, 28 (6), pp. 585-608; Cappellin, R., The territorial dimension of modern industry and the scope of regional industrial and labour market policies (2000) Preventing Unemployment in Europe: A New Framework for Labour Market Policy, pp. 166-187. , Klemmer, P. and Wink, R (Eds), Elgar, Cheltenham; Cappellin, R., The territorial dimension of the knowledge economy: collective learning, spatial changes and regional urban policies (2007) American Behavioral Scientist, 50 (7), pp. 897-921; Cohen, W.M., Levinthal, D.A., Absorptive capacity – a new perspective on learning and innovation (1990) Administrative Science Quarterly, 35 (1), pp. 128-152; Coro, G., Grandinetti, R., Industrial districts responses to the network economy vertical integhration versus pluralist global exploration (2001) Human Systems Management, 20 (3), pp. 189-199; Eisenhardt, K.M., Martin, J.A., Dynamic capabilities. what are they?

Specifically, we examine firm interaction with the knowledge and capabilities of outside organizations and the effect on the firm's bottom line. We use the impulseresponse function of the vector auto-regressive model to gain insight into this relationship by estimating the time required for the effect of each activity level to reach outputs, the spillover effects. We apply this methodology to pharmaceutical firms, which we classify into two sub-groups - large firms and medium and small firms - based on sales. Our results show that the impact of an activity on any other activity is delayed by three years for large firms and by one to two years for small and medium firms.

Internal capabilities refer to internal R&D and human capital. Network resources account for decisions to outsource R&D which co-depend on informal incoming knowledge spillovers. Appropriation accounts for formal and informal knowledge protection mechanisms. This empirical study discusses the determinants of R&D outsourcing with respect to various theories of the firm that complement each other. Data from the Third and Fourth European Community Innovation Survey for Belgium reveal internal R&D intensity to exert a strong positive association with R&D outsourcing intensity, emphasising the importance of absorptive capacity and the complementary nature of internal and outsourced R&D. Network resources are also positively associated, suggesting that firms involved in a mixture of informal and formal networks tend to outsource relatively more R&D. In terms of appropriation mechanisms there is a positive association formal and informal protection, but this last mostly through complexity of design. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We conceptualize absorptive capacity along two dimensions-technological effort and technological capability-and hypothesize that these two dimensions have opposing moderating effects which can result in theoretical and empirical misspecifications if ignored. We argue that firms with higher technological efforts have greater motivation to search for knowledge from their alliance partners, place more value on the external knowledge and mobilize such knowledge, and face lower internal resistance to assimilate and to use the knowledge. On the other hand, firms with stronger technological capability have lower motivation to search for knowledge from alliance partners, put lower value on the knowledge, make less intense efforts to mobilize it, and face greater internal resistance in assimilating and using the knowledge. By analyzing longitudinal data of 178 U.S.-based public semiconductor firms during 1988-2000 using negative binomial regression, we find that as firms increase their technological effort, the benefits from alliance network resources in terms of technological innovations come at a higher rate. In contrast, as technological capabilities of firms increase, the benefits from the alliance network resources in the form firm technological innovations come at a lower rate. We further discuss important theoretical and managerial implications of our findings. © 2015.","Absorptive capacity; Alliance network; Alliance portfolio; Technological capability; Technological effort","Regression analysis; Absorptive capacity; Alliance networks; Alliance portfolio; Technological capability; Technological effort; Motivation; industrial enterprise; innovation; networking; semiconductor industry; technology adoption; technology transfer; United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ahuja, G., Collaboration networks, structural holes, and innovation: a longitudinal study (2000) Adm.

Knowledge brokering is defined as being an activity undertaken by intermediaries (individuals, organizations, networks, etc.) acting as connectors to link producers and end users of new knowledge. Despite the increase in research dealing with the importance of knowledge brokering in the health sector, little is still known about the profiles and practical practices of knowledge brokers. This article provides an empirical portrait of knowledge brokering in the Web 2.0 era. It goes beyond the rhetoric and the opposing anecdotal evidence to respond to two questions: i) What is the profile of knowledge brokers? and ii) How does knowledge brokering work in the health sector in Quebec, Canada? The data used come from a survey carried out in 2011 among a representative sample of knowledge brokers using Web 2.0 technologies in Canada. The theory of knowledge absorptive capacity is used as the analytical reference to describe the black box of the knowledge brokering process. Results: The authors of this article provide a detailed profile of knowledge-brokering activities (stages, behavior, support, etc.), brokers' individual attributes (age, gender, experience, training, preferences, etc.), as well as exchanged-knowledge specific attributes. Conclusion: This study shows the complexity and diversity of the knowledge brokers' tasks and emphasizes the importance of the training and support required to develop brokers' competencies and the collaborations required by the digital media coverage of knowledge as well as by the mobilization of evidence for decision making and public health policies. © 2014 Infonomics Society.","Absorptive capacity; data survey; Evidence-informed decision making; Knowledge broker; Knowledge transfer; public health policies; Web 2.0 technology","Decision making; Digital storage; Public health; Surveys; Absorptive capacity; Data surveys; Informed decision; Knowledge brokers; Knowledge transfer; Public health policies; Web 2.0 Technologies; Knowledge management",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lomas, J., The in-between world of knowledge brokering (2007) BMJ, 334 (7585), pp. 129-132; Pentland, D., Forsyth, K., Maciver, D., Walsh, M., Murray, R., Irvine, L., Sikora, S., Key characteristic of knowledge transfer and exchange in healthcare: Integrative literature review (2011) Journal of Advanced Nursing, 67 (7), pp. 1408-1425; Dobbins, M., Robeson, P., Ciliska, D., Hanna, S., Cameron, R., O'Mara, L., De Corby, K., Mercer, S., A description of a knowledge broker role implemented as part of a randomized controlled trial evaluating three knowledge translation strategies (2009) Implementation Science, 4, pp. 1-9; Ziam, S., Knowledge brokers and how to communicate knowledge in 2010 (2010) Allergy, Asthma & Clinical Immunology, 6 (4), p.

The review is organised on the basis of a model of KM as the interplay between people, processes and technology, supported by organizational structures. This stems from a philosophy that the people and technological aspects of KM always need to be balanced appropriately. Adding the content of the knowledge to this model yields the five sub-sections of the chapter. Content aspects cover tacit and explicit knowledge and the SECI model. Process aspects include KM maturity models and absorptive capacity. People aspects highlight Communities of Practice, sticky knowledge, storytelling, cognitive maps and social network analysis. Structural and strategic aspects include exploration/exploitation, personalization/codification, alignment with business strategy and ba. Technological aspects feature ontologies. The chapter concludes that the main challenge for the future is to develop KM models that incorporate enough complexity to be effective, while remaining simple enough that people who are not KM experts can use them. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Absorptive Capacity; Knowledge Management; Knowledge Transfer; Social Network Analysis; Tacit Knowledge",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alavi, M., Kane, G.C., (2008) Knowledge Management: An Evolutionary Review (Advances in Management Information Systems, 12, pp. 63-85. , Social networks and information technology: Evolution and new frontiers.

Attention is paid to key variables (such as interorganizational trust, absorptive capacity at the organizational and interorganizational levels, and social learning) related to the cross-cultural diffusion/utilization/adaptation of knowledge against the backdrop of interconnected public, private, and not-for profit organizations and institutions. Findings also highlight changes in variables studied over these decades within and across the research streams. These include the emergence of crosscultural co-processes (including co-design of diffusion plans in networked settings) and their roles in successful knowledge diffusion/utilization. In sum, this meta-analysis examining research over three decades possesses implications for understanding diffusion and social change today and makes recommendations for research agendas in the decade ahead. © Journal of International Communication.","Co-processes; Cross-cultural communication; Development communication; Diffusion; Participatory communication",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anupindi, R., Sivakumar, S., ITC's e-choupal: A platform strategy for rural transformation (2007) Business solutions for the global poor: Creating social and economic value, pp. 173-182. , R.S.

The studies started by Cohen and Levinthal (1989, 1990) appeared to pique the interest of science on the construct ""absorptive capacity of knowledge"" as one of the fundamental processes of organizational learning. Research on the subject has grown since the 90s Many studies continue to seek further discussions and empirical research on the organizational ability to identify, assimilate, transform and exploit knowledge of the internal and external environment aimed at collective learning. It should be noted that the publications on the absorptive capacity of knowledge range from the individual level to the level of entire nations. Given this context, the objective of this work is to identify which internal and external factors that influence the absorption capacity of knowledge focused on innovation. As for the methodology it is literature, qualitative approach and descriptive. This is why we held an integrative literature review, with the help of a bibliographic manager, coupled with a search directed to authors and terms. The results were identified fifteen internal factors and external nine. Internal factors relate to the continuous acquisition, distribution and use of relevant knowledge within the company. External factors are those which, although external to the company, when in contact, increase organizational capacity to absorb knowledge. Also identified the importance of the process of opening up to external sources of knowledge as an important element to assess the innovative potential of the organization. One of the important considerations in the analysis relates to the role of the capabilities captured by the intensity of research and development efforts, and highly qualified personnel (traditional AC notion) and the ability to interact and access external sources of knowledge (enhanced CA) in innovative performance. This points to the need to develop internal capabilities (technological and human) in conjunction with networking capabilities and use of external sources of knowledge and information in order to produce added value and innovation. Based on in-depth analysis carried out in the revised literature, it concluded that companies can manage and develop the CA through the implementation of different methods that encourage the sharing and transfer of organizational and inter-intra knowledge.","Capacity to absorb knowledge; Innovative capacity; Knowledge focused on innovation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ahuja, G., Lampert, C., Entrepreneurship in the large corporation: A longitudinal study of how established firms create breakthrough inventions.

This paper aims to open up the black box of IT-enabled absorptive capacity by theorizing and testing the role of IT in two organizational learning processes, which are either interactive with partners in the knowledge alliance or non-interactive with others in the knowledge network. In particular, we formulate a model explaining how a firm's IT investment moderates its organizational learning processes in knowledge alliances and networks, which sheds light on the role of IT as an enabler of absorptive capacity. Using a panel data set from the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, the results show the moderating role of IT in strengthening the organizational learning processes from knowledge alliance experience to coinvented knowledge and from knowledge network centrality to assimilated knowledge, which, in turn, improve firm competitiveness. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Absorptive capacity theory; Innovation; IT-enabled absorptive capacity; Knowledge alliances; Knowledge networks; Organizational learning","Black-box testing; Competition; Innovation; Investments; Technology transfer; Absorptive capacity; IT-enabled absorptive capacities; Knowledge alliances; Knowledge networks; Organizational learning; Knowledge management",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alavi, M., Leidner, D.E., Review: Knowledge management and knowledge management systems: Conceptual foundations and research issues (2001) MIS Q., 25 (1), pp. 107-136; Allen, J., James, A., Gamlen, P., Formal versus informal knowledge networks in R&D: A case study using social network analysis (2007) R&D Manage., 37 (3), pp. 179-196; Amesse, F., Cohendet, P., Technology transfer revisited from the perspective of the knowledge-based economy (2001) Res.

Multi-business firms are distributed knowledge systems in which business units are extensively involved in internal knowledge transfer processes. Business units play different roles within their respective corporate knowledge networks as knowledge providers, knowledge receivers, both or neither.Design/methodology/approach – Survey data from a sample of 225 business divisions were analyzed using a multivariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).Originality/value – This study contributes to existent research on knowledge transfer and performance outcomes by demonstrating the usefulness of the knowledge role as an integrating concept within this literature. It also extends the four-role framework to the prescriptive domain and tests its normative implications in an intensive internal knowledge transfer setting which has to date gone relatively unnoticed, as is that of multi-business firms.Practical implications – Four knowledge roles are distinguished according to the extent to which a business division provides the rest of the corporation with knowledge or receives knowledge from the rest of the corporation, thus exploring the issue of internal knowledge transfer from an integrated perspective that takes the directionality of knowledge flows and the position within the knowledge network into account.Findings – Results indicate that divisions which occupy knowledge roles that reveal the possession of unique knowledge (knowledge signaling) or guarantee the accumulation of new knowledge (knowledge learning) outperform those divisions that have access to spilled knowledge (knowledge depreciation) or have no access to any kind of knowledge (knowledge insulation). © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Absorptive capacity;

Our aim is to investigate the processes that give rise to the observed network configuration in order to identify hampering factors of knowledge diffusion, with a particular interest in the role of geographical proximity and differences in territorial features. We make use of the data on project proposals submitted to the 7th Framework Programme in the field of biotechnology. We build a non-valued inter-regional R&D cooperation network among a set of European regions and study its formation through exponential random graph models (Frank and Strauss in J Am Stat Assoc 81(395):832–842, 1986; Wasserman and Pattison in Psychometrika 61(3):401–425, 1996). Besides the role played by absorptive capacities, the empirical results reveal that contiguity affects the pattern of cross-regional collaborations not only via edge formation among neighbours but also through a triadic closure process which links neighbouring regions to non-neighbours. Furthermore, triadic closure is found out to be in play among highly populated regions and regions including capital cities. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","L14; O31; O38",,,,,,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7: 266834","This research has received funding from the European Community’s Seventh Framework Programme under Grant Agreement No. 266834 and also supported by the Programme FOuille de Reseaux d’Innovation (FORI- S752FORI1R) funded by Saint-Etienne Metropole, LHC, GATE-LSE , Eurolio (january 2011-october 2014).

This chapter provides essential insights into the process steps necessary for successfully preparing for distant collaboration in cross-industry networks as well as for creating multilateral cross-industry networks. Cross-industry networks comprise an intensive exchange and development of knowledge in a process of mutual learning and adaptation through collaborative arrangements with specific innovation partners. The role of the technology managers, who identify synergic effects across the process stage of identifying potential absorptive capacity, and the function of the network managers, who act as interface between the firm and its external partners, are key for the exchange of ideas and for building expertise for the early innovation phase. Also cultural issues must be considered when implementing multilateral cross-industry networks, as processes of knowledge work beyond organizational boundaries entail organizational cognitive distance. An established network culture based on common values like trust and openness as well as shared norms, objectives and interests facilitates the sharing and transfer of knowledge. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

To study this adoption process and get insights into the underlying mechanisms, in this work we synthesize the theories on social networks and knowledge transfer. We propose a research framework in which the absorptive capacity of a potential adopter and the collective disseminative capacity of connected adopters act as two key determinants of knowledge transfer in a socioeconomic network, and these two capacities substitute for each other in affecting HIT adoption. We also propose that, in a network setting, the mechanism of knowledge transfer manifests quite differently from that of social contagion in its impact on the diffusion process at different stages of adoption. Using a large longitudinal data set covering adoption decisions of more than five thousand hospitals across a thirteen-year horizon, we find strong support for our hypotheses. Our analysis shows that knowledge flow in provider networks plays a key role in fostering technology diffusion in initial years, allowing the contagion effect to set in sooner for quicker adoption in later years. Therefore, recent efforts at multiple levels to form integrated healthcare delivery networks should accelerate HIT adoption.

Gathering potentially valuable knowledge does not necessarily mean that other parts of the organisation will benefit from that knowledge. Knowledge exploitation will only occur when employees inside the organisation share new knowledge amongst its members, reshape, transform and then meaningfully integrate it with existing knowledge to enhance and create new processes, products and/or services. The ability of an organisation to acquire and assimilate external knowledge and then transform and exploit the knowledge within the firm is referred to as the Absorptive Capacity (AC). The absorption of knowledge can be facilitated by social connections with the external environment (e.g. customers, suppliers, universities and research institutions) and internally within an organisation, to share the externally acquired knowledge and ideas amongst employees. Current literature has not yet described and synthesised the entire process of knowledge absorption starting with the conditions that trigger the need for new knowledge, followed by the organisational factors influencing knowledge flow and -sharing, the prerequisites (antecedents) for effective knowledge absorption, through to the resulting organisational outcomes associate with enhanced knowledge absorption. The social networks that facilitate the acquisition and transfer of external knowledge and the internal networks required to exploit and absorb the knowledge within the organisation, are also important in this process. This paper provides a review of existing Absorptive Capacity (AC) and Social Networking (SN) literature and highlights the central and essential role of external (inter-organisational) and internal (intra-organisational) social networks in the process of acquiring, assimilating, transforming and exploiting (i.e. absorbing) knowledge in organisations. The various elements are synthesised into a comprehensive conceptual Knowledge Absorption Process (KAP) model that deepens our understanding of the absorption of externally acquired knowledge through external and internal social networks and highlights management interventions that will support this process and create competitive advantage for the business.

By focusing on tacit and explicit knowledge the paper introduces a model for identification of knowledge in relation to four task situations on the shop floor in a manufacturing environment. The paper discusses and suggests how the transfer of tacit and explicit knowledge can be improved. Further the paper discusses two dramatic shifts in organizational settings i.e. from operations management and to project management in the sending unit before a transfer and reverses in the receiving unit after relocation. Finally the paper discusses how “dispatching capacity” and “absorptive capacity” can improve the process. © Springer-Verlag London 2014.","Dispatching capacity; Knowledge transfer; Manufacturing networks; Manufacturing relocation; Organizational change","Information management; Knowledge management; Project management; Dispatching capacity; Knowledge transfer; Longitudinal case study; Manufacturing environments; Manufacturing networks; Organizational change; Organizational setting; Tacit and explicit knowledge; Manufacture",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Andersen, E.S., Towards a project management theory for renewal projects (2006) Proj Manage J, 37 (4), pp. 15-30; Cohen, W.M., Levinthal, D.A., Absorptive capacity: A new perspective on learning and innovation (1990) Adm Sci Q, 35 (1), pp. 128-152; Davenport, T.H., Prusak, L., (1998) Working knowledge—how Organizations Manage What they Know, , Harvard Business School Press, Boston, Massachusetts; Dyer, J., Nobeoka, K., Creating and managing a high performance knowledge-sharing network: The Toyota case (2000) Strateg Manage J, 21, pp. 345-367; Eisenhardt, K.M., Building theories from case study research (1989) Acad Manage J, 14 (4), pp. 532-550; Eskerud, P., Jepsen, A.L., (2013) Project Stakeholder Management, , Gower, Surrey, England; Ferdows, K., (2006) Transfer of Changing Production Know-How, Production and Operations Management, 15 (Spring), p. 1; Hislop, D., (2013) Knowledge Management in organizations—a Critical Introduction, , Oxford University Press, New York; Johnson, B., Lorenz, E., Lundvall, B.-A., Why all this fuss about codified and tacit knowledge?

Yet, the adoption of HIT among hospitals in the United States has been rather slow. This work synthesizes the theories on social networks and knowledge transfer by introducing the notion of a disseminative capacity to study HIT adoption. We argue that members within a socioeconomic system possess both absorptive and disseminative capacities that influence knowledge transfer among them. Accordingly, a research framework is proposed, in which the absorptive capacity of a potential adopter and the disseminative capacity of connected adopters act as two key determinants, and these two capacities substitute for each other in affecting HIT adoption. Using a large panel dataset covering adoption decisions of over 5,000 hospitals across a 13-year horizon, we find strong support for our hypotheses derived from this framework. © 2014 IEEE.","Absorptive capacity;

The study on how FDI's spillover improving innovation capability in local firms by network embeddedness has become a hot topic in the academic and business circles. Integrating network embeddedness, knowledge acquisition, absorptive capacity with innovation performance, this paper is to explain how network embeddedness affects innovation performance by knowledge acquisition for local firms. By building a conceptual model and empirical analysis, it shows that network embeddedness can improve innovation performance by knowledge spillover during FDI clustering, and absorptive capacity plays the intermediary role between them. Furthermore, it provides some theoretical guidelines and suggestions for local firms to improve their innovation capability. © 2013 IEEE.","Absorptive capacity; FDI clustering; innovation performance; knowledge acquisition; network embeddedness","Absorptive capacity; Economic globalization; FDI clustering; Foreign direct investments; Innovation capability; Innovation performance; Integrating networks; Network embeddedness; Engineering research; Industry; Knowledge acquisition; Silicon; Innovation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hallin, C., Holm, U., Sharma, D.D., Embeddedness of innovation receivers in the multinational corporation: Effects on business performance [J] (2011) International Business Review, 20, pp. 362-373; Nell, C., Andersson, U., The complexity of the business network context and its effect on subsidiary relational (over-) embeddedness[J] (2012) International Business Review., 21, pp. 1087-1098; Li, C.-Y., Knowledge stickiness in the buyer-supplier knowledge transfer process: The moderating effects of learning capability and social embeddedness[J] (2012) Expert Systems with Applications, 39, pp. 5396-5408; Cohen, W.M., Levinthal, D.A., Innovation and learning: The two faces of R&D [J] (1989) Economic Journal, 99, pp. 569-596; Cohen, W.M., Levinthal, D.A., Absorptive capacity: A new perspective on learning and innovation [J] (1990) Administrative Science Quarterly, 35, pp. 132-146; Granovetter, M., Economic action and social structure: The problem of embeddedness[J] (1985) American Journal of Sociology, 91 (3), pp. 481-510; Dunning, J.H., Location and multinational enterprise: A neglected factor (2009) [J] Journal of International Business Studies, 40, pp. 5-19; Hagedoon, J., Cloodt, M., Measuring innovative performance: Is there an advantage in using multiple indicators (2003) [J] Research Policy, 32, pp. 1365-1379; Lin, H.-M., Huang, H.-C., Lin, C.-P., How to manage strategic alliances in OEM-based industrial clusters: Network embeddedness and formal governance mechanisms [J] (2012) Industrial Marketing Management, 41, pp. 449-459; Inkpen, T., Social capital, networks and knowledge transfer [j] (2005) Academy of Management Review, 30 (1), pp. 146-165; Julia, L., Fang, S.C., Fang, S.R., Tsai, F.S., Network embeddedness and technology transfer performance in r&dconsortia in taiwan [j] (2009) Technovation, 29, pp. 875-894; Lane Koka, P., The reification of absorptive capacity: A critical review and rejuvenation of the construct [j] (2006) Academy of Management Review, 31 (4), pp. 833-863; Hu, M.-C., Knowledge flows and innovation capability [j] (2008) Technological Forecasting &Social Change, 75, pp. 1236-1254; Nonaka, T., (1995) Knowledge-Creating Company: How Japanese Create the Dynamics of Innovation M], , Oxford University Press; Roweley, T., Behrens, D., Krachardt, D., Redundant governance structures: An analysis of structural and relational embeddedness in the steel semiconductor industries [j] (2000) Strategic Management Journal, 21 (3), pp. 369-386; Uzzi, B., The sources and consequences of embeddedness for the economic performance of organizations (1996) American Sociology Review, 61, pp. 674-698; Lei, X., Yongsheng, X., The role of multiple networks embedded to cluster innovation[j] (2012) Economic Geography ( in Chinese), pp. 108-112. , 4; Ye, Z., Lixia, M., Embeddedness, fdi-dominant cluster and local enterprise developments [J] (2008) China Industrial Economic(inChinese), pp. 122-130. , 2","School of Business, , Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China",,"Soochow University, Center for Enterprise Innovation and Development (CEID);San Jose State University, Lucas Graduate School of Business;China Institute for Science and Technology Policy at Tsinghua University;UC Berkeley, School of Information;IEEE Technology Management Council",,"2013 ""Suzhou-Silicon Valley-Beijing"" International Innovation Conference: Technology Innovation and Diasporas in a Global Era, SIIC 2013","8 July 2013 through 9 July 2013","Suzhou",101062,,9781479903399,,,"English","Proc.

A concept that is closely linked to IA is absorptive capacity, which is defined as the ability to exploit knowledge that is embodied in IA. The main objective of this paper is to explore what is meant by absorptive capacity, before examining the empirical relationship between absorptive capacity and various dimensions of firm performance. The latter is not straightforward because there is no agreed approach to measuring absorptive capacity. The approach taken here is to use data on whether firms sourced knowledge or collaborated externally from the UK Community Innovation Survey. This allows us to show that there is a clear and important link between absorptive capacity and various dimensions of firm performance. In this paper, we aim to contribute to the special issue by focusing on the role mobilising knowledge can play in improving the performance of firms in the private sector, which has a particular resonance in these difficult economic times. Our central message is that for firms to perform better in hard times, they need to mobilise their absorptive capacity. Government must therefore consider whether they should focus their efforts on helping firms directly to increase their own absorptive capacity or on improving the flow of (local) knowledge through supporting networks. Our view is that, while maintaining existing policies that aim to increase connections and encourage collaborations between firms, there should be a greater emphasis on the firm because evidence shows that unless firms have sufficient absorptive capacity, they will not be able to fully internalise the benefits of any knowledge spillovers, no matter how large such spillovers may potentially be. © 2013 Academy of Social Sciences.","absorptive capacity; firm performance; intangible assets",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Almeida, P., Dokko, G., Rosenkopf, L., Startup size and the mechanisms of external learning: Increasing opportunity and decreasing ability?

The empirical basis of the conceptual framework is demonstrated with an in-depth case study of Zhejiang Institute of Modern Textile Industry, an innovation intermediary that greatly facilitates knowledge spillover, application and integration in the Shaoxing Textile industrial cluster in China. This case analysis shows that an innovation intermediary can play the roles of technology gatekeeper, technology spanner, technical problem solver, and innovation resource integrator within the knowledge system of an industrial cluster. In addition, examining the process of intermediation reveals that absorptive capacity, knowledge complexity, presence of a structural hole and network centrality are critical to the role in which innovation intermediaries function within the knowledge systems of industrial clusters. © 2013 © 2013 Korean Society for Innovation Management and Economics (KOSIME).","absorptive capacity; industrial cluster; innovation intermediary; knowledge complexity; structural hole",,,,,,"106341-001; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 71202129","The funding provided by the International Development Research Center (IDRC, Grant no. 106341-001), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, Grant no. 71202129), and the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no.

Design/methodology/approach: Questionnaire data from a sample of 118 business divisions were analyzed using stepwise linear regression. Findings: The results from a three-effect model for the analysis of knowledge transfer indicate that knowledge outflow improves division performance, while knowledge inflow damages it when absorptive capacity is weak. The overall effect of knowledge transfer is therefore beneficial with the exception of the cases of receiving divisions with low levels of absorptive capacity. Practical implications: These results indicate that knowledge transfer contributes to overall corporate performance, since knowledge outflow impacts positively on division performance in all cases and knowledge inflow impacts negatively on division performance only in some cases. Setting aside the obvious task of promoting knowledge transfer within the firm, one important concern for corporate officers would be to prevent situations in which a division lacks the absorptive capacity to play its role within a corporate network. Originality/value: This work contributes to existent literature by disentangling the effects of knowledge transfer according to different theoretical perspectives, and it provides an empirical examination in a setting which is intensive in knowledge transference, as is that of business divisions from related diversified firms. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Absorptive capacity; Diversification; Knowledge inflow; Knowledge outflow; Knowledge transfer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Allee, V., The art and practice of being a revolutionary (1999) Journal of Knowledge Management, 3 (2), pp. 121-131; Allee, V., The value evolution addressing larger implications of an intellectual capital and intangibles perspective (2000) Journal of Intellectual Capital, 1 (1), pp. 17-32; Allee, V., Value network analysis and value conversion of tangible and intangible assets (2008) Journal of Intellectual Capital, 9 (1), pp. 5-24; Allee, V., Value-creating networks: Organizational issues and challenges (2009) The Learning Organization, 16 (6), pp. 427-442; Argote, L., Ingram, P., Knowledge transfer: A basis for competitive advantage in firms (2000) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 82 (1), pp. 150-169; Argyres, N., Evidence on the role of firm capabilities in vertical integration decisions (1996) Strategic Management Journal, 17 (2), pp. 129-150; Barney, J.B., Returns to bidding firms in mergers and acquisitions: Reconsidering the relatedness hypothesis (1988) Strategic Management Journal, 9 (5), pp. 71-78; Barney, J.B., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Barney, J.B., Arikan, A.M., The resource-based view: Origins and implications (2001) The Blackwell Handbook of Strategic Management, pp. 124-188. , Hitt, M.A., Freeman, E.R., Harrison, J.S.

The model incorporates horizontal spillovers, vertical spillovers and relative absorptive capacity and four types of R and D cooperation are studied: no cooperation, horizontal cooperation, vertical cooperation and simultaneous horizontal and vertical cooperation and the private incentives for R and D cooperation are addressed. It is found that upstream firms and downstream firms have divergent interests regarding the choice of cooperative settings and that technological spillovers and relative absorptive capacity increase the likelihood of the emergence of cooperation in a decentralized equilibrium. © 2013 Asian Network for Scientific Information.","Horizontal spillovers; R and D cooperation; Relative absorptive capacity; Vertical spillovers","Absorptive capacity; External knowledge; Horizontal cooperations; Horizontal spillovers; R and D cooperation; Technological spillovers; Vertical spillovers; Technology; Industry",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Atallah, G., Vertical R&D spillovers, cooperation, market structure and innovation (2002) Econ.

In this study, mental and behavioral factors, such as the prestige and reputation of individual and the movement for people within the organization, are introduced to examine their impact on knowledge transferring between individuals. A conceptual model is proposed which involves two actors in the process of knowledge transfer, knowledge sender and knowledge recipient, their corresponding disseminative capacity and absorptive capacity, as well as mental and behavioral factors. Accordingly, a network model is constructed in which nodes act as the knowledge senders or recipients. The process of knowledge transfer on the network is inspected from two mental aspects-the prestige and reputation of individuals. The degree of impact of the factors on knowledge disseminative will or knowledge absorptive will of actors is measured. A personnel movement mechanism is also introduced to simulate the dynamic processes of knowledge transfer within the organization. The simulation results show that the positive mental factors for individuals can promote the disseminative capacity of knowledge senders, accelerate the processes of knowledge transfer, and improve the knowledge stock of the organization. © 2013, IGI Global.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Albino, V., Garavelli, A.C., Schiuma, G., Knowledge transfer and inter-firm relationships in industrial districts: The role of the leader firm (1998) Technovation, 19 (1), pp. 53-63; Cohen, W., Levinthal, D., Absorptive capacity: A new perspective on learning and innovation (1990) Administrative Science Quarterly, 35 (1), pp. 128-152; Cowan, R., Jonard, N., Network structure and the diffusion of knowledge (2004) Journal of Economic Dynamics & Control, 28 (8), pp. 1557-1575; Franco, A.M., Filson, D., Spin-outs: knowledge diffusion through employee mobility (2006) Journal of Economics, 37 (4), pp. 841-860; Herrera, L., Muñoz-Doyague, M.F., Nieto, M., Mobility of public researchers, scientific knowledge transfer, and the firm's innovation process (2010) Journal of Business Research, 63 (5), pp. 510-518; Kane, A.A., Argote, L., Levine, J.M., Knowledge transfer between groups via personnel rotation: Effects of social identity and knowledge quality (2005) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 96 (1), pp. 56-71; Kim, H., Park, Y., Structural effects of R and D collaboration network on knowledge diffusion performance (2009) Expert Systems with Applications, 36 (5), pp. 8986-8992; Liao, S., Fei, W.C., Chen, C.C., Knowledge sharing, absorptive capacity and innovation capability: an empirical study of Taiwan's knowledge-intensive industries (2007) Journal of Information Science, 33 (3), pp. 340-359; Liao, S., Wu, C., Hu, D., Tsui, K., Relationships between knowledge acquisition, absorptive capacity and innovation capability: an empirical study on Taiwan's financial and manufacturing industries (2009) Journal of Information Science, 36 (1), pp. 19-35; Lin, M., Li, N., Scale-free network provides an optimal pattern for knowledge transfer (2010) Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 389 (3), pp. 473-480; März, W., Friedrich-Nishio, M., Grupp, H., Knowledge transfer in an innovation simulation model (2006) Journals of Technological Forecasting & Social Change, 73 (2), pp. 138-152; Morone, P., Taylor, R., Knowledge diffusion dynamics and network properties of face-to-face interactions (2004) Journal of Evolutionary Economics, 14 (3), pp. 327-351; Mu, J., Tang, F., MacLachlan, D.L., Absorptive and disseminative capacity: Knowledge transfer in intra-organization networks (2010) Journal of Expert Systems with Applications, 37 (1), pp. 31-38; Robbins, S.P., Organizational behavior (2003), Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall; Simonin, B., Transfer of marketing knowhow in international strategic alliances: An empirical investigation of the role and antecedents of knowledge ambiguity (1990) Journal of International Business Studies, 30 (3), pp. 463-490; Tang, F., Mu, J., MacLachlan, D.L., Disseminative capacity, organizational structure and knowledge transfer (2010) Journal of Expert Systems with Applications, 37 (2), pp. 1586-1593; Von Neumann, J., The general and logical theory of automata (1951) Cerebral mechanism in behavior: The Hixon Symposium, pp. 289-326. , L.

The research identifies drivers and barriers for eco-innovation, and highlights effects induced through collaboration between SMEs and local authorities, on the one hand, and consultancies, on the other. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on an exploratory qualitative interview study among German SMEs of the metal and mechanical engineering industry that have participated in ""Ecoprofit"", an intermediary based program that aims at introducing organizations to the concept of sustainable development through implementation of eco-innovations. Findings: The key findings are that first, the proactive approach by a public intermediary (here local authority) is one essential push factor to trigger eco-innovations in SMEs with low absorptive capacity. Second, it is found that SMEs may need facilitation for eco-innovation from different types of intermediaries (public and private) with different levels of support, which can range from customized and individual to more loosely held support, such as networks. Originality/value: This study discusses the challenges of corporate sustainability with a focus on eco-innovations for SMEs and proposes a ""complex intermediary"" consisting of a local authority and consultancies as one means to engage SMEs in sustainability. Moreover, it focuses on SMEs in the B2B context, organizations that are often overlooked despite their vast impact. Furthermore, by using a single industry approach, in-depth findings for the metal and mechanical engineering industry are presented. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Absorptive capacity; Eco-efficiency; Eco-innovations; Germany; Innovation; Inter-organizational learning; Intermediaries; Knowledge transfer; Learning networks; Public private partnerships; Small to medium-sized enterprises; Sustainability-oriented innovation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Afsarmanesh, H., Camarinha-Matos, L.M., On the classification and management of virtual organisation breeding environments (2009) International Journal of Information Technology and Management, 8 (3), pp. 234-259; Altham, W., Benchmarking to trigger cleaner production in small businesses: Dry cleaning case study (2007) Journal of Cleaner Production, 15 (8-9), pp. 798-813; Ar, I., Baki, B., Antecedents and performance impacts of product versus process innovation: Empirical evidence from SMEs located in Turkish science and technology parks (2011) European Journal of Innovation Management, 14 (2), pp. 172-206; Arqum, (2010) Database, , www.arqum.de/datenbank/, available at, (accessed 1 June 2010); Azzone, G., Noci, G., Seeing ecology and 'green' innovations as a source of change (1998) Journal of Organizational Change Management, 11 (2), pp. 94-111; Bagliardi, B., Dormio, A., An empirical investigation of innovation determinants in food machinery enterprises (2009) European Journal of Innovation Management, 12 (2), pp. 223-242; Bagliardi, B., Colacino, P., Dormio, A.I., Innovation characteristics of small and medium enterprises (2011) Journal of Technology Management & Innovation, 6 (2), pp. 83-92; Balcázar, N., Sustainability, climate protection and economy: Three areas successfully combined through ECOPROFIT® (2010) Reviews in Environmental Science and Biotechnology, 9 (1), pp. 29-33; Battaglia, M., Bianchi, L., Frey, M., Iraldo, E., An innovative model to promote CSR among SMEs operating in industrial clusters: Evidence from an EU project (2010) Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 17, pp. 133-141; Beise-Zee, M., Rennings, K., Lead markets and regulation: A framework for analyzing the international diffusion of environmental innovation (2005) Ecological Economics, 52 (1), pp. 5-17; Bennett, M., Schaltegger, S., Zvezdov, D., Exploring the corporate practice of sustainability accounting (2011) Accounting for Climate Change - What and How to Measure, pp. 94-100. , Csutora, M., Kerekes, S.

Drawing on the absorptive capacity perspective, we argue that firms with a high level of such capacity seem to benefit more from their alliances. Specifically, three indicators of technology strategy relevant to absorptive capacity, including proportion of R&D alliances in an alliance portfolio, technological distance, and R&D intensity are explored to examine their impacts on innovation performance. Using alliance data from the Securities Data Company (SDC), patent data from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), firm data from S&P COMPUSTAT, and co-patents granted as a proxy for the alliance innovation performance, these results show that while alliance networks potentially provide a firm with access to various benefits that can help in creating new technologies, R&D alliances in particular are more suitable than other types of partnerships to achieve this aim. Furthermore, given that information transfer and learning are key benefits of R&D alliances, moderate technological distance is needed if such alliances are to be successful. In particular, the innovation performance peaks at the moderate level of technological distance with alliance partners when this interacts with the proportion of R&D alliances in a firms alliance portfolio. Finally, R&D alliances should be regarded as a complement to rather than a substitute for a firms internal R&D. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, this article aims to extend understanding in the field of knowledge management by examining how social networks can accumulate social capital and build up potential and absorptive capacity for the creation of new knowledge. Design/methodology/approach: The authors reviewed the literature on open electronic social networks and closed interpersonal networks, social capital and absorptive capacity to examine how different types of networks accumulate different dimensions of social capital and develop different measures of absorptive capacity. A model was developed that hypothesizes that open networks can impact the structural and cognitive dimension of social capital but have less than a moderate effect on the relational dimension. The model is tested in the academic community using a sample of 22 research faculties from ten different research institutions within the MIS departments and five from Marketing. Findings: The paper posits that electronic open networks have a significantly higher impact on the structural and cognitive dimension of social capital and a less than moderate impact on the relational dimension. Electronic open networks are, thus, best suited for acquiring and assimilating new knowledge, however the transformation and exploitation of knowledge require the cohesive ties of closed networks. Research limitations/implications: The combinative effect of electronic open networks and closed interpersonal networks is critical for the development of a potential and realized absorptive capacity and the creation of new knowledge. It is essential for researchers to examine the effect of different types of social networks on the process of knowledge creation and whether social capital accumulated in interpersonal networks can be leveraged in electronic open networks to enhance the process of knowledge creation. Practical implications: Businesses benefit from this line of research in knowing how well different types of social network are suited to the different phases of knowledge creation. Leveraging the capacity of open electronic networks and closed interpersonal networks can foster innovation. Originality/value: There is no existing literature that has examined the relationship between different types of social networks, social capital, absorptive capacity, and knowledge creation. This paper provides a foundation for future studies that examine the combinative effect of closed interpersonal and open electronic networks. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Internet; Knowledge management; Knowledge transfer; Open systems; Social influence; Social knowledge; Social networks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ahuja, G., Collaboration networks, structural holes, and innovation: A longitudinal study (2000) Administrative Science Quarterly, 45 (3 September), p. 425; Ahuja, M.K., Carley, K.M., Network structure in virtual organizations (1999) Organization Science, 10 (6), p. 741. , November/December; Ahuja, M.K., Galleta, D.F., Carley, K.M., Individual centrality and performance in virtual R&D groups: An empirical study (2003) Management Science, 49 (1 January), p. 21; Berg, S., Duncan, J., Friedman, (1982) Joint Venture Strategies and Corporate Innovation, , Oelgeschlager, Gunn and Hain, Cambridge, MA; Borgatti, S.P., Cross, R., A relational view of information seeking and learning in social networks (2003) Management Science, 49 (4), pp. 432-445; Bourdieu, P., Wacquant, L., (1992) An Invitation to Reflexive Sociology, , The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL; Burt, R.S., (1992) Structural Holes: The Social Structure of Competition, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA; Burt, R.S., The network structure of social capital (2000) Research in Organizational Behavior, 22, pp. 345-431. , Staw, B.M., Sutton, R.I.

In particular, the model shows that exogenous technology shock from developed North, vehicled via trade, transmits to developing Souths and induces productivity growth. This spillover capture, aided by human capital based adoptive capability, better governance and institution, causes increase in income and welfare and subsequently, leads to decline in income inequality. Dynamism of Southern Engines of Growth - India and China - caused them to emerge as 'core' South. Thus, triangular innovation diffusion between dynamic and peripheral South is also simulated to show how the backward or peripheral South could catch up via South-South Cooperation in a declining North-South trends in trade. This accrual of benefits could lead to sustained productivity growth and consequential relief of incidence of poverty in low-income countries. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","D3; Gini; Governance; Hub-and-spokes; Human capital; I3; Innovation and absorptive capacity; O1; Poverty gap; Spillover","D3; Gini; Governance; Hub-and-spokes; Human capitals; I3; O1; Poverty gap; Spillover; Economic and social effects; Productivity; International trade; globalization; governance approach; hub and spoke network; human capital; income distribution; innovation; low income population; North-South relations; poverty determinant; socioeconomic impact; spillover effect; technology adoption; technology diffusion; welfare impact; China; India",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Acemoglu, D., Dell, M., Productivity differences between and within countries (2010) Am.

The FDI spillovers literature addresses this very issue, primarily examining whether the presence of foreign firms in a host market leads to technology spillovers and upgrading in domestic firms. A key finding is that spillovers depend on the absorptive capacity of the domestic firm. Yet, in conceptualizing absorptive capacity, scholars have largely overlooked how social structure shapes it. Integrating insights from social networks, technology upgrading, and innovation literatures, I emphasize that a domestic firm's ability to absorb spillovers depends on the social structure it is embedded in. I argue that ties with foreign firms reduce the constraints that domestic firms usually face in searching for and transferring in foreign technologies. However, while search benefits from sparse network structures, transfer is facilitated by cohesive ones. Also, while affect-based ties might motivate foreign firms sufficiently to share information with domestic firms at the search stage, reciprocal benefits and social monitoring conferred by common third-party ties are necessary in the transfer stage. Any effect of ties also depends on the routine repertoire of domestic firms. Put together, these arguments offer a more socialized account of the spillover process. © 2012 Academy of International Business All rights reserved.","absorptive capacity; knowledge and productivity spillovers; networks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adler, P.S., Kwon, S.-W., Social capital: Prospects for a new concept (2002) Academy of Management Review, 27 (1), pp. 17-40; Aldrich, H.E., Auster, E.R., Even dwarfs started small: Liabilities of age and their strategic implications (1986) Research in Organization Behavior, 8, pp. 165-198; Amburgey, T.L., Kelly, D., Barnett, W.P., Resetting the clock: The dynamics of organizational change and failure (1993) Administrative Science Quarterly, 38 (1), pp. 51-73; Appleyard, M.M., How does knowledge flow?

Trade in goods represents a relevant mechanism for technology transfer: imports, especially of capital and intermediate goods, can directly improve productivity (Coe and Helpman 1995; Coe et al. 1997)1 and firms may learn from the embodied technology they purchase. For example, they may reverse-engineer imported machines, adjust them to the needs of local production processes and also learn through communication processes with foreign suppliers, to the extent that they have sufficient absorptive capacity for technology spill-overs to occur. An impact on firm’s productivity deriving from “learning by exporting�? is less certain (see the contributions of Clerides et al. 1998; Bernard and Jensen 1999; Hallward-Driermayer et al. 2002; Kraay et al. 2006); however, it is quite plausible that contacts with foreign buyers favour the acquisition of knowledge on process improvements, quality control and market information. As mentioned in Chapter 5, the growing “fragmentation�? of international production (Jones and Kierzkowski 2001) implies that firms integrating into buyer-or producer-driven chains, forming “global production networks�? (Gereffi 1999), have to meet requirements that satisfy international standards. Global firms provide knowledge by sharing product designs and production techniques, representing a fast track to upgrading processes and products (Schmitz 2004), which may induce higher domestic productivity and increase competition among suppliers. Trade in services presents some specific features, such as output intangibility that require a close relationship between producers and customers, and may need a commercial presence or the movement of natural persons, either the producer or the consumer, to be delivered. Compared to goods, trade in services favours closer contacts with foreign companies, as the customer is more involved in the “production process�? (e.g. in consultancy, accountancy, legal services). Accordingly, both foreign and local firms participate in learning processes and can use the acquired knowledge to improve their productivity. Services trade is also characterised by more informal channels of knowledge diffusion (OECD 2006b) and technological change may occur through “demonstration effects�?. Progress in ICT and the increasing diffusion of e-commerce and e-business play a crucial role in facilitating trade in services by reducing the importance of traditional borders, and impact on the related knowledge flows. In turn, electronic transactions are heavily influenced by liberalisation progress taking place in the financial services’ sector and in telecommunications, where however several countries maintain national control. Open trade policies and international cooperation to remove unnecessary trade obstacles may thus enhance technology flows, showing positive effects especially for developing countries. A central question concerns the impact of liberalisation and of regulatory cooperation at bilateral and regional levels, where these processes are increasingly taking place. Preferential trade agreements (PTAs) are growing at an unprecedented rate (Fiorentino et al. 2006) and trade between parties to such agreements represents nearly 40 per cent of total global trade in goods, even if the importance of trade at preferential tariffs is much less (see World Bank 2005b2). This wave of “new regionalism�? is characterised by rapidly increasing North-South and South-South agreements, where bilateral trade relations are prevailing (between two countries, between a RIA and one country, or between distinct RIAs), leading in some cases to “hub-andspoke�? systems. As border barriers to merchandise trade have been substantially reduced, more attention has been drawn to forms of deeper integration, especially in North-South agreements. In this context, some criticism has been raised on regulatory harmonisation among parties with uneven bargaining power. Northern countries typically offer developing countries market access for goods in exchange of services liberalisation and the acceptance of rules governing investment and other trade related matters (competition policy, e-commerce, IPRs etc., see Chapter 5), while developing countries wish to secure access to large markets, to reinforce internal regulatory reforms through external treaty obligations, or to accede agreements out of fear to remain excluded (“domino effect�?). Distributive effects may be different, that is non-egalitarian in bilateral relations characterised by unequal power. Some economists suggest, notably, that in the case of goods “trade diversion�? may prevail on “trade creation�? if there is a discrimination against more efficient non-regional suppliers. Therefore, to the extent that a PTA causes trade diversion from more technologically advanced sources of inputs, this negative effect should be offset through multilateral trade agreements, aimed at removing all trade barriers on knowledge-intensive goods from all countries. Some authors observe however that technology diffusion and productivity gains tend to be regional, and that knowledge diffusion might indeed be influenced by closer contacts and geographical proximity (Schiff and Wang 2003b). In the case of services, the implications of PTAs on trade flows may be different: even if multilateral liberalisation is expected to produce the largest benefits, countries almost certainly gain also from preferential liberalisation, which in some cases might be easier to achieve. Nevertheless, negative consequences can occur in sectors characterised by location-specific sunk costs (telecommunications, professional, financial and distribution services), where foreign direct investment plays a large role. A simultaneous entry of foreign suppliers (through multilateral liberalisation) would be preferable to a sequential entry (through preferential agreements), as first entrants might be less efficient but gain long-term advantages (“incumbency effects�?). This is particularly relevant for countries that export mainly goods and import services, as the benefits of obtaining preferential access for goods may be small and temporary, while the costs of granting preferential access to the partner detaining comparative advantages in services could be large and durable (Fink and Mattoo 2002). Since trade has a direct bearing on the diffusion of knowledge, all institutions and regulations facilitating commerce play a core role to enhance international knowledge flows and technology transfer. The next sections survey the main types of national policy tools that affect trade, and describe how these instruments are coordinated by bilateral, regional and multilateral agreements, focusing in particular on regulations affecting trade in capital goods, intermediate inputs and services, for their impact on knowledge diffusion processes. © 2011 Selection and editorial matter, Helge Hveem and Lelio Iapadre; individual contributors, their contribution.

Particularly, the networks within which firms operate and their properties (e.g., structural holes) are suggested to affect firms' innovation performance. One stream of research finds that structural holes are conducive to firms' innovation because of the heterogeneous information about alternatives that firms can obtain through spanning structural holes. Another stream of research finds that structural holes inhibit knowledge transfer from knowledge sources and hence deter firms to innovate. This study aims to reconcile the two conflicting streams of research by identifying the conditions under which structural holes will be conducive to organizational innovation. Based on structural holes theory and absorptive capacity literature, this paper constructs a model to explain the moderating effects of ITenabled absorptive capacity on the relationship between structural holes and organizational innovation performance. This paper proposes that independently, structural holes may not influence innovation performance. However, when the exploration and transformation dimensions of ITenabled absorptive capacity are high, structural holes should positively affect innovation performance. Also, the exploitation dimension should positively affect innovation performance. The proposed methodology, measurement, and potential contributions of the study are discussed.","Innovation performance; IT-enabled absorptive capacity; Structural holes","Absorptive capacity; Heterogeneous information; Innovation performance; IT-enabled absorptive capacity; Knowledge sources; Knowledge transfer; Moderating effect; Organizational innovation; Structural holes; Industry; Information systems; Knowledge management; Research; Societies and institutions; Innovation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adler, P.S., Kwon, S.-W., Social capital: Prospect for a new concept (2002) Academy of Management Review, 27, pp. 17-40; Ahuja, G., Collaboration networks, structural holes, and innovation: A longitudinal study (2000) Administrative Science Quarterly, 45, pp. 425-455; Argote, L., McEvily, B., Reagans, R., Managing knowledge in organizations: An integrative framework and review of emerging themes (2003) Management Science, 49, pp. 571-582; Brown, J.S., Duguid, P., Knowledge and organization: A social-practice perspective (2001) Organization Science, 12, pp. 198-213; Burt, R.S., (1992) Structural Holes: The Social Structure of Competition, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Burt, R.S., Structural holes and good ideas (2004) American Journal of Sociology, 110 (2), pp. 349-399. , DOI 10.1086/421787; Cassiman, B., Veugelers, R., In search of complementarity in innovation strategy: Internal R&D and external knowledge acquisition (2006) Management Science, 52, pp. 68-82; Chesbrough, H., (2003) Open Innovation, , Harvard University Press: Cambridge, MA; Chi, L., Ravichandran, T., Andrevski, G., Information technology, network structure, and competitive action (2010) Information Systems Research, 21 (3), pp. 543-570; Chi, L., Holsapple, C.W., Srinivasan, C., Digital systems, social networks, and competition: The co-evolution of IOS use and structural position as antecedents of competitive action (2008) Journal of Organizational Computing and Electronic Commerce, 18 (1), pp. 61-94; Clemons, E.K., Row, M.C., Sustaining IT Advantage: The role of structural differences (1991) MIS Quarterly, 15 (3), pp. 275-292; Cohen, W.M., Levinthal, D.A., Absorptive capacity: A new perspective on learning and innovation (1990) Administrative Science Quarterly, 35, pp. 128-152; Coleman, J.S., Social capital in the creation of human capital (1988) American Journal of Sociology, 94, pp. S95-S120; Dodgson, M., Gann, D., Salter, A., The role of technology in the shift towards open innovation: The case of Procter & Gamble (2006) R and D Management, 36 (3), pp. 333-346. , DOI 10.1111/j.1467-9310.2006.00429.x; Fritsch, M., Kauffeld-Monz, M., The impact of network structure on knowledge transfer: An application of social network analysis in the context of regional innovation networks (2008) The Annals of Regional Science, 44 (1), pp. 21-38; Garud, R., Nayyar, P.R., Transformative capacity: Continual structuring by intertemporal technology transfer (1994) Strategic Management Journal, 15, pp. 365-385; Granovetter, M., The impact of social structure on economic outcomes (2005) Journal of Economic Perspectives, 19 (1), pp. 33-50; Gulati, R., Alliances and networks (1998) Strategic Management Journal, 19, pp. 293-317; Hansen, M.T., The search-transfer problem: The role of weak ties in sharing knowledge cross organization subunits (1999) Administrative Science Quarterly, 44, pp. 82-111; Hargadon, A., (2003) How Breakthroughs Happen: The Surprising Truth about How Companies Innovate, , Harvard Business School Press: Boston, MA; Hargadon, A., Sutton, R., Technology brokering and innovation in a product-development firm (1997) Administrative Science Quarterly, 42, pp. 716-749; Hauser, J., Tellis, G., Griffin, A., Research on innovation: A review and agenda for Marketing science (2006) Marketing Science, 25 (6), pp. 687-717; Huston, L., Sakkab, N., Connect and Develop: Inside procter & gamble's new model for innovation (2006) Harvard Business Review, 84 (3), pp. 58-66; Inkpen, A.C., Tsang, E.W.K., Social capital networks, and knowledge transfer (2005) Academy of Management Review, 30 (1), pp. 146-165; Jansen, J.J.P., Van Den Bosch, F.A.J., Volberda, H.W., Managing potential and realized absorptive capacity: How do organizational antecedents matter?

Yet this knowledge is widely distributed around the globe, so accessing and absorbing it can be very difficult. We focus on how can industrial scientists recognize, pull in, and apply so much new knowledge in their product innovation work. We frame our study with the knowing as practice perspective, which suggests how knowledge professionals draw on their embodied intuition, physical and sensory referents, and on their socially embedded interactions and work contexts. Based on 85 interviews with drug discovery scientists and managers, we develop empirically grounded theory for how these industrial scientists can access and absorb so much knowledge. We find that the collective sense of the scientist is a major medium for drawing on distributed know-how as needed to explore ill-structured problems. The collective sense of the scientist is a complex, intuitive sense that relies on the acting body of the scientist working in the lab with materials and apparatus and using all senses, similar to studies of academic scientists. However, the industrial sense of the scientist is collective - socially created, reinforced, and shared. Our analysis suggests that three social networks together produce and maintain this collective sense by creating a rich social context for knowing: 1) interactions among the sensory bodies of scientists in everyday practice; 2) connections with institutions of sciences; and 3) engagement with the overall innovation process in their firms. We describe each social network, how it works, and how it helps absorb so much knowledge. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Absorptive capacity; Complex products; Drug discovery; Embedded interaction; Grounded theory; Innovation process; Know-how; New product; Product innovation; Pull-in; Social context; Social Networks; Industrial management; Industry; Technology transfer; Innovation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Grandori, A., A Rational Heuristic Model of Economic Decision Making (2011) Rationality and Society, 23. , in press; Orlikowski, W., Knowing in Practice: Enacting a Collective Capability in Distributed Organizing Organization Science, 13 (3), pp. 249-273; Knorr-Cetina, K., (1999) Epistemic Cultures: How the Sciences Make Knowledge, , Harvard University Press Cambridge, MA; Barley, S.R., Technicians in the Workplace: Ethnographic Evidence for Bringing Work into Organization Studies Administrative Science Quarterly, 41 (4), pp. 404-441; Schon, D., (1983) The Reflective Practitioner: How Professionals Think in Action, , Basic Books New York; Grinnell, F., (2009) Everyday Practice of Science: Where Intuition and Passion Meet Objectivity and Logic, , Oxford University Press New York; Dane, E., Pratt, M., Exploring Intuition and its Role in Managerial Decision Making The Academy of Management Review, 32 (1), pp. 33-54; Latour, B., (1987) Science in Action, , Harvard University Press Cambridge MA; Keller, E., (1983) A Feeling of the Organism: The Life and Work of Barbara McClintock, , Freeman San Francisco; Brown, J.S., Duguid, P., Organizational Learning and Communities of Practice Organization Science, 2 (1), pp. 40-57; Henderson, R., Cockburn, I., Measuring Competence?

The aim is to investigate the networking competencies of stakeholders involved in the university technology transfer process using absorptive capacity theory to explore how knowledge is externally retained and maintained through these network relations. Design/methodology/approach: This paper undertakes an inductive theory building approach using in-depth multiple stakeholder interviews (n=30). The transcripts and results were analysed using open coding and NVivo. Six technology transfer meetings were also observed. Findings: The findings show that developing and maintaining network relationships can significantly aid the development and retention of knowledge within the university technology transfer process. It was found that conscious effort is made to retain relationships with network stakeholders. Prior knowledge, partner knowledge complementarity and reciprocity, resulting in collective learning, were found to motivate stakeholders to engage in external knowledge retention strategies. The results also supported suggestions in previous literature that relative capacity is an antecedent for absorptive capacity within organisations. Research limitations/mplications: The paper helps in establishing a research agenda for knowledge retention in technology transfer where traditionally the emphasis has been on development of knowledge. The absorptive capacity framework provides a consistent theoretical basis for exploring the role of stakeholders in this area. Originality/value: The paper focuses on how knowledge can be retained in technology transfer settings rather than being restricted to that of development. The use of the absorptive capacity framework has also enabled the concept of relative capacity to be developed within the research giving much needed empirical investigation into its relevance and feasibility. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Absorptive capacity; Business enterprise; Knowledge management; Networking; Relative capacity; Stakeholder analysis; University technology transfer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alvesson, M., Deetz, S., (2000) Doing Critical Management Research, , Sage, London; Blau, P.M., (1964) Exchange and Power in Social Life, , John Wiley, New York, NY; Borgatti, S.P., Cross, R., A relational view of information seeking and learning in social networks (2003) Management Science, 49 (4), pp. 432-445; Caloghirou, Y., Ioanna, K., Tsakanikas, A., Internal capabilities and external knowledge sources: Complements or substitutes for innovative performance?

Whereas, the majority of former work considers a direct effect of networks on knowledge transfer, the authors examined two intermediate mechanisms: the access to strategic resources and the individual's absorptive capacity. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative study was used to collect data, via a face-to-face questionnaire with key individuals in small and medium entreprises members of consortia in Tunisia. Data were analysed with a structural equations approach, based on partial least squared-path modelling techniques. Findings: Results emphasize the impact of network size, strength of ties and absorptive capacity on the strategic resource access and the impact of indirect ties, strength and range of ties on the absorptive capacity. Moreover, while absorptive capacity positively impacts good practice transfer, no support was found to the effect of resource access. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation of this study concerns the measuring of good practice transfer, since in literature there are often imprecise proxies. Also, while the authors have investigated the global impact of strategic resources, future research needs to treat them separately. Finally, a longitudinal study allows better capture of the evolution of the phenomenon studied. Practical implications: Top management and directors at a consortium level need to pay careful attention to the social context within which knowledge transfer efforts occur. Resources exchanged and the absorptive capacity developed through social interactions must be designed to increase knowledge flows between firms. Originality/value: The paper links two bodies of research often studied separately in inter-organizational research: literature on social networks and that on inter-organizational learning. It is hoped that the paper contributes to a cross-fertilization of the two fields. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Best practice; Information management; Knowledge transfer; Learning organizations",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ahuja, G., Collaboration networks, structural holes, and innovation: A longitudinal study (2000) Administrative Science Quarterly, 45 (3), p. 425; BarNir, A., Smith, K.E., Interfirm alliances in the small business: The role of social network (2002) Journal of Small Business Management, 40 (3), pp. 219-232; Bhagavatula, S., Elfring, T., van Tilburg, A., van de Bunt, G.G., How social and human capital influence opportunity recognition and resource mobilization in India's handloom industry (2010) Journal of Business Venturing, 25 (3), pp. 245-260; Bouty, I., Interpersonal and interaction influences on informal resource exchanges between R&D researches across organizational boundaries (2000) Academy of Management Journal, 43 (1), pp. 50-65; Burt, R.S., (1992) Structural Holes: The Social Structure of Competition, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA; Burt, R.S., The social capital of structural holes (2001) New Directions in Economic Sociology, pp. 201-247. , Guillen, M., Collins, R., England, P., Meyer, M.

However, less attention has been paid to the dual process of knowledge transfer, which covers knowledge dissemination and absorption. This study operationalizes the concept of disseminative capacity and analyses differences in disseminative capacity of network members. Theoretical analysis and simulation results showed that the sizes of network, knowledge transfer speed and disseminative capabilities and absorptive capabilities of the individuals in the network have effect on knowledge equilibrium of networks over time. Furthermore, the results showed that the more powerful is a dominant knowledge holder in the network, the quicker the network will converge to a specified knowledge state. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Absorptive capacity; Disseminative capacity; Intra-organization networks; Knowledge transfer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Albert, R., Jeong, H., Barabasi, A.-L., Error and attack tolerance of complex networks (2000) Nature, 406, pp. 378-382; Baldwin, A., The roles of an ""ability"" construct in a Theory of Behavior (1959) Talent and Society: New Perspectives in Identification of Talent, pp. 195-234. , In, McClelland D, Baldwin A, Bronfenbrenner U, Strodtbeck F.

From a dataset of 952 Spanish firms and 35 industrial districts, we provide empirical evidence that industrial districts are spaces with dense networks of information and knowledge transfer, inter-personnel relationships and a strong specialised stock of human capital, which are accessible and shared by all firms embedded in such a district. However, we explain the complementarity between district and firm-specific capacities in order to develop the notion of absorptive capacity, by indicating that the diffusion of shared competences is neither easy nor direct and that it requires a firm's internal learning effort to better absorb localised knowledge spillovers. Results enable us to shed new light on how firms' knowledge creation and diffusion processes benefit from these external knowledge flows. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Absorptive capacity; Industrial district; Knowledge creation capacity; Knowledge spillovers; Organisational learning; Shared competences",,,,,,"ECO2009-12522; ACOMP2010/233","The authors wish to thank the three anonymous referees for their helpful and valuable suggestions.

A multiple case study of Brazilian subsidiaries of three multinational corporations using in-depth interviews, based on a conceptual model consisting of four propositions, was conducted to identify factors linked to the knowledge transfer process and to assess their influence on that transfer. The first proposition tries to assess explicit knowledge, primarily through the use of IT tools; the second analyzes the role of the subsidiary within the corporate network and how it influences the degree of knowledge sharing. The third assesses the influence of subsidiary absorptive capacity and the fourth analyzes the impact of worker exchange programs on knowledge sharing between headquarters and foreign subsidiaries. Study results confirm the four propositions and enable the identification of relationships between factors, especially explicit knowledge and worker expatriation as complementary factors in knowledge transfer strategies. © 2011 Brazilian Administration Review.","Knowledge transfer; Multinational corporations; Product development",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Asakawa, K., Evolving headquarters subsidiary dynamics in international R&D: The case of Japanese multinationals (2001) R&D Management, 31 (1), pp. 1-14. , doi: 10.1111/1467-9310.00192; Birkinshaw, J.M., Hood, N., Multinational subsidiary evolution: Capability and charter change in foreign-owned subsidiary companies (1998) The Academy of Management Review, 23 (4), pp. 773-795. , doi: 10.2307/259062; Birkinshaw, J.M., Morrison, A.J., Configurations of strategy and structure in multinational subsidiaries (1995) Journal of International Business Studies, 26 (4), pp. 729-753. , doi: 10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8490818; Björkman, I., Barner-Rasmussen, W., Li, L., Managing knowledge transfer in MNCs: The impact of headquarters control mechanisms (2004) Journal of International Business Studies, 35 (5), pp. 443-455. , doi: 10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400094; Björkman, I., Fey, C.F., Park, H.J., Institutional theory and MCN subsidiary HRM practices.

Particularly in the automotive industry, companies tend to reduce the number of their suppliers and bundle them into hierarchical supplier pyramids characterised by low trust. However, establishing knowledge-transfer routines regarding production processes within the network can stabilise buyer-supplier cooperation and counterbalance the power embodied by the central buyer. Beside (1) inter-firm knowledge-sharing routines, this case study also analyses another potential source of inter-organisational competitive advantages: (2) partner-specific absorptive capacity. Both can form the basis for firms to loosen the classical supplier pyramids, to collaborate as partners and share mutual product development processes.

Although existing literature supports the positive direct effect of the incoming knowledge to an organization's performance, the effect of certain relational factors (which may play either the role of facilitators or impeders) has drawn limited research. This paper examines the effect of two relational factors -the level of absorptive capacity and the powerful relationships- on the knowledge transfer within strategic alliances. In consistency with prior work, this study supports that: (i) the transfer of external knowledge is a determinative factor for an organization's performance and (ii) the effective exploitation of the incoming knowledge follows in the wake of the organization's ability to absorb the knowledge that is externally derived. In an attempt to expand this prior work, the role of powerful relationships formed between partners in a strategic alliance, is perceived as a potential factor able to mitigate the negative moderating effect of the limited absorptive capacity on mthe direct relationship between knowledge and performance. The aforementioned relationships are depicted on a conceptual framework to empirically investigate the case of company services which are in great need of obtaining new knowledge in order to develop business model innovations, taking the Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) as a case study. Empirical evidence from 109 MVNOs operating across Europe are provided to support the moderating roleof two specific factors in the knowledge transfer process within strategic alliances. The results indicate that organizations' limited absorptive capacity determines the positive direct relationship between the incoming knowledge and organizational performance. Moreover, the powerful relationships between knowledge seekers and keepers are found to be a relational factor to the transfer of knowledge which mitigates the negative moderating effect of limited absorptive capacity thus making this knowledge activity more effective.","Absorptive capacity; Business model/innovation; External knowledge; Knowledge transfer; Powerful relationships","Absorptive capacity; Business models; External knowledge; Knowledge transfer; Powerful relationships; Industry; Knowledge management",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ancona, D., Caldwell, D., Bridging the boundary: External activity and performance in organization teams (1992) Administrative Science Quarterly, 37 (4), pp. 150-169; Carmines, E., Zeller, A., (1979) Reliability and validity assessment, , Sage: Beverly Hills, CA; Chesbrough, H., Rosenbloom, R., The role of the business model in capturing value from innovation: Evidence from Xerox Corporation's technology spin-off companies (2002) Industrial and Corporate Change, 11 (3), pp. 529-555; Chin, W., The partial least squares approach for structural equation modeling (1998) In G.

We use telephone line penetration rates and personnel flows to estimate the direct spillover effect. Our results show that direct knowledge spillovers through telecommunication networks and personnel flows are important components of international R&D spillovers in China. These direct channels of spillover effectively accelerate China's economic growth. Therefore, China should invest more in human capital and in its telecommunication network to enhance the absorptive capacity of direct R&D spillovers, and to increase communication with other nations, in particular the USA and Japan. More subsidies to domestic R&D research and purchase of intermediate goods will help to raise China's R&D intensity. © 2010 The Authors China & World Economy © 2010 Institute of World Economics and Politics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.","Economic effect; Personnel flow; R&D spillover; Technology proximity; Telecommunication network",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aghion, P., Howitt, P., A model of growth through creative destruction (1992) Econometrica, 60 (2), pp. 323-351; Cai, H., Gao, J., Xu, X., An empirical study on the effectiveness of R&D investment (2004) Scientific Studies, 22 (1), pp. 5-58; Caves, R.E., Causes of direct investment: Foreign firms' shares in Canadian and United Kingdom manufacturing industries (1974) The Review of Economics and Statistics, 56 (3), pp. 279-293; Chang, Y., Park, J.Y., A sieve bootstrap for the test of a unit root (2003) Journal of Time Series Analysis, 24 (4), pp. 379-400; Coe, D., Helpman, E., International R&D spillovers (1995) European Economic Review, 39 (5), pp. 859-887; DiCiccio, J.T., Efro, B., Bootstrap confidence intervals (1996) Statistical Science, 11 (3), pp. 189-212; Engle, R., Granger, C., Co-integration and error correction: Representation, estimation, and testing (1987) Econometrica, 55 (2), pp. 251-276; Globerman, S., Foreign direct investment and 'spillover' efficiency benefits in Canadian manufacturing industries (1979) The Canadian Journal of Economics, 12 (1), pp. 42-56; Griliches, Z., Issues in assessing the contribution of R&D to productivity growth (1979) Bell Journal of Economics, 10 (1), pp. 92-116; Grossman, G., Helpman, E., (1991) Innovation and Growth in the Global Economy, , Cambridge, MIT Press; Hall, B., Jaffe, A.B., Trajtenberg, M., The NBER patent citations data file: Lessons, insights and methodological tools (2001) National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper No. 8498, , National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA; Hu, A.G.Z., Jefferson, G.H., Qian, J., R&D and technology transfer: Firmlevel evidence from Chinese industry (2005) Review of Economics and Statistics, 87 (4), pp. 780-786; World Telecommunication/ICT Indicators Database (2006), http://www.itu.int/en/, International Telecommunication Union, online; cited 21 May 2008].

This study develops and tests a model that examines the relationship between the learning efforts of focal firms from their international business affiliates (IBAs) - organizations located outside the focal firm's domestic market with whom the focal firm has a relationship - and the focal firms' RBLC. This learning process refers to the transfer of knowledge from the IBA to the focal firm. Results indicate that while learning effectiveness positively influences the RBLC of the focal firm, learning efficiency has a negative impact on RBLC. The IBA's home country network centrality and the tie strength between the focal organization and the IBA are found to influence learning effectiveness positively. Tie strength also enhances learning efficiency. Finally, the findings indicate that the IBA's home country network centrality enhances the strength of the ties between the focal organization and its IBA. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Absorptive capacity; Effective learning; Efficient learning; Network centrality; Resource-based learning capacity; Tie strength",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Almeida, P., Kogut, B., Localization of knowledge and the mobility of engineers in regional networks (1999) Manage.

The relationship between factors of influencing knowledge transfer and knowledge transfer performance is discussed with the methods of theoretical and quantitative analysis. The results show that the knowledge transfer among supply chain members can be divided into three levels, including between supply chain and external environment, between members of supply chain, and organization's internal knowledge transfer. Knowledge transfer performance among supply chain members is affected by knowledge characteristics, communication and trust degree among supply chain members, supply chain members' knowledge absorptive capacity, knowledge transfer channels' richness and knowledge transfer cost.

Absorptive capacity of knowledge senders has been examined in the field of organizational learning and innovation literature, and many accumulated findings have emerged. However, absorptive capacity is necessary but not sufficient to full understanding of knowledge transfer. In this paper we argue that knowledge senders' disseminative capacity, i.e., the ability of knowledge holders to efficiently, effectively, and convincingly frame knowledge in a way that other people can understand accurately and put into practice, plays an equally important role in knowledge transfer process. We examine this argument by employing a single-layer perceptron neural network model (SLPM) in a simulation study with two different network structures to get robust results. We demonstrate that both the disseminative capacity of knowledge senders and the absorptive capacity of knowledge recipients play important roles in knowledge transfer. Also, we found that the prominent knowledge holder plays a paramount role in knowledge transfer under quite different organizational structures. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the revised network model falls short of explaining rapid internationalization of firms. While they indicate a ""specific relationship development process"" used by born-global managers, Johanson and Vahlne (2003) still suggest the existence of an incremental learning and ""responsive"" model, which is based on pre-existing relationships. We extend current theory in arguing that born-global managers can use both pre-existing and newly formed relationships, to quickly and proactively develop new knowledge for rapid commercialization of their products. Proactive, advanced relationship-building capability is based around locating partners with technological knowledge with a view to ensuring ease of sharing knowledge. We explore the development of trust and inter-firm partnerships in established and newly formed networks and how these lead to tacit knowledge, absorptive capacity and new knowledge generation. While Johanson and Vahlne (2003) emphasize ""market specific experience and operation experience"" we emphasize ""technological experience"". The reason that knowledge sharing is able to proceed quickly is that the shared ""technological knowledge"" allows rapid transfer and development of new knowledge and the drive to commercialize a product before a competitor, promotes the ""mutual need"" (co-dependency) to act quickly, characteristic of technology-based industries, which face rapid change. As an outcome of the born-global manager's ability to locate new partners through existing networks, new international links may be quickly developed, with internationalization being an outcome, but not necessarily a driver of behaviour in smaller born-global supply chains.

However, merely possession of knowledge does not guarantee an edge in competition. In this paper, we operationalize the concept of disseminative capacity, analyze differences in disseminative capacity of network members and simulate dynamic behavioral patterns of intra-organization networks in knowledge transfer process. Theoretical analysis and simulation results convince us that absorptive capacity and disseminative capacity either interactively or separately determine how knowledge flows or is transferred effectively and efficiently between members of intra-organization networks. Results showed that knowledge equilibrium of networks over time depends on the size of network, knowledge transfer speed, and disseminative capabilities and absorptive capabilities of the individuals in the network. Moreover, the results showed that the more powerful is a dominant knowledge holder in the network, the quicker the network will converge to a specified knowledge state. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Given the current emphasis on networks as vehicles for innovation and change in health service delivery, the ability to conceptualise and measure organisational enablers for the social construction of knowledge merits attention. This study aimed to develop a composite tool to measure the organisational context for evidence-based practice (EBP) in healthcare. Methods. A structured search of the major healthcare and management databases for measurement tools from four domains: research utilisation (RU), research activity (RA), knowledge management (KM), and organisational learning (OL). Included studies were reports of the development or use of measurement tools that included organisational factors. Tools were appraised for face and content validity, plus development and testing methods. Measurement tool items were extracted, merged across the four domains, and categorised within a constructed framework describing the absorptive and receptive capacities of organisations. Results. Thirty measurement tools were identified and appraised. Eighteen tools from the four domains were selected for item extraction and analysis. The constructed framework consists of seven categories relating to three core organisational attributes of vision, leadership, and a learning culture, and four stages of knowledge need, acquisition of new knowledge, knowledge sharing, and knowledge use. Measurement tools from RA or RU domains had more items relating to the categories of leadership, and acquisition of new knowledge; while tools from KM or learning organisation domains had more items relating to vision, learning culture, knowledge need, and knowledge sharing. There was equal emphasis on knowledge use in the different domains. Conclusion. If the translation of evidence into knowledge is viewed as socially mediated, tools to measure the organisational context of EBP in healthcare could be enhanced by consideration of related concepts from the organisational and management sciences. Comparison of measurement tools across domains suggests that there is scope within EBP for supplementing the current emphasis on human and technical resources to support information uptake and use by individuals. Consideration of measurement tools from the fields of KM and OL shows more content related to social mechanisms to facilitate knowledge recognition, translation, and transfer between individuals and groups. © 2009 French et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,,,,,,,"We wish to acknowledge the support of the North West Strategic Health Authority for funding the continuation of this work into the development and piloting of a benchmark tool for the organisational context of EBP.",,,,,,,,,,"Pope, C., Robert, G., Bate, P., Le May, A., Gabbay, J., Lost in translation: A multi-level case study of the metamorphosis of meanings and action in public sector organizational innovation (2006) Public Admin, 84, pp. 59-79. , 10.1111/j.0033-3298.2006.00493.x; Nicolini, D., Managing knowledge in the healthcare sector: A review (2008) Int J Manag Rev, 10, pp. 245-263. , 10.1111/j.1468-2370.2007.00219.x; Rashman, L., Withers, E., Hartley, J., (2008) Organizational Learning, Knowledge and Capacity: A Systematic Literature Review for Policy-makers, Managers and Academics, , London: Department for Communities and Local Government; Carlile, P.R., Transferring, translating, and transforming: An integrative framework for managing knowledge across boundaries (2004) Organ Sci, 15, pp. 555-568. , 10.1287/orsc.1040.0094; Carlile, P.R., A pragmatic view of knowledge and boundaries: Boundary objects in new product development (2002) Organ Sci, 13, pp. 442-455. , 10.1287/orsc.13.4.442.2953; Bate, S.P., Robert, G., Knowledge management and communities of practice in the private sector: Lessons for modernizing the national health service in England and Wales (2002) Public Administration, 80 (4), pp. 643-663; Newell, S., Edelman, L., Scarborough, H., Swan, J., Bresen, M., 'Best practice' development and transfer in the NHS: The importance of process as well as product knowledge (2003) Health Serv Manage Res, 16, pp. 1-12. , 10.1258/095148403762539095 12626022; Dopson, S., Fitzgerald, L., (2005) Knowledge to Action: Evidence-based Healthcare in Context, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Hartley, J., Bennington, J., Copy and paste, or graft and transplant?

Design/methodology/approach: An embedded case study of Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW) examining core drivers that impact on inter-unit knowledge transfers between six events and exhibitions (E&E) units located in Europe, Asia, and Australasia. Findings: The data highlight that effective knowledge transfer between E&E units depends on a combination of key drivers, such as social network ties, absorptive capacity, learning adaptiveness, and communication channels. The findings suggest that the search for and transfer of knowledge depends foremost on the applicability of context-specific knowledge rather than its complexity. Research limitations/implications: The focus is on one specific manufacturing sector and specific drivers to knowledge transfer in this sector, limiting the generalisation of the findings. Also, the findings were drawn from a limited sample of in-depth practitioner interviews and did not integrate any outcome measures to successful knowledge transfer in their approach. Practical implications: The paper offers guidelines for firms and specifically E&E managers to observe the specificity of knowledge and how this affects its limited applicability for other identical units. Originality/value: Managers foremost need is to examine the unique context under which knowledge is acquired; only then are they in a position to decide how much knowledge transfer via different network and communication channels is needed between geographically dispersed E&E units. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Automotive industry; Knowledge transfer; Manufacturing systems; Multinational companies",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alavi, M., Leidner, D.E., Review: Knowledge management and knowledge management systems: Conceptual foundations and research issues (2001) MIS Quarterly, 25 (1), pp. 107-36; Argote, L., Ingram, P., Knowledge transfer: A basis for competitive advantage in firms (2000) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Process, 82 (1), pp. 150-69; Barlett, C.A., Ghoshal, S., (1989) Managing Across Borders: The Trans-National Solution, , Harvard Business School Press, Cambridge, MA; Barner-Rassmusen, W., Bjoerkman, I., Knowledge sharing between MNC units: A social capital perspective (2002), paper presented at the 28th EIBA Conference Athens, Greece; Belzowsky, B.M., Flynn, M.S., Richardson, B.S., Sims, M.K., Harnessing knowledge: The next challenge to inter-firm cooperation in the North American auto-industry (2003) The Journal of Automotive Technology and Management, 3 (1-2), pp. 9-29; Bennett, R., Gabriel, H., Organisational factors and knowledge management within large marketing departments: An empirical study (1999) Journal of Knowledge Management, 3 (3), pp. 212-25; Birkenshaw, J., Why is knowledge management so difficult?

Using estimation techniques from the productivity spillover literature, this paper tests for the presence of environmental spillovers from foreign firms. On the basis that foreign-owned firms may encourage firms in their extended supply chain to improve their environment-related management practices, evidence for the existence of environmental spillovers should be easier to find than productivity spillovers where firms naturally attempt to minimise intra-industry knowledge leakage. In this paper we show that, first, foreign-owned firms are more likely to implement environmental management systems (EMS) and, second, that the presence of foreign-owned firms in those sectors that a firm supplies can encourage good environmental practice. This is especially true if a firm is foreign, has high absorptive capacity, and operates in the presence of formal and informal networks. © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"competitiveness; environmental economics; environmental management; firm ownership; foreign direct investment; industrial investment; multinational enterprise; productivity; spillover effect; state owned enterprise",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aitken, B.J., Harrison, A.E., 'Do Domestic Firms Benefit from Direct Foreign Investment?

The novelty of this approach is the combination of both methods. In this case we analyzed the citations to a very influential paper published in 1990 that contains, for the first time, the term Absorptive Capacity. A bibliometric map identified the terms and the theories associated with the term while two techniques from the citation network analysis recognized the main papers during 15 years. As a result we identified the articles that influenced the research for some time and linked them into a research tradition that can be considered the backbone of the ""Absorptive Capacity Field"". © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

It then develops a model of a knowledge production function that can be estimated at the firm level and the sector level using the knowledge base matrix. It identifies the impact of own knowledge base, absorptive capacity to exploit intersectoral spillovers, and absorptive capacity to exploit intrasectoral spillovers, on new technology generation. It permits a study of the dynamics of knowledge generation without having to resort to additional information on the R&D activities of firms. Finally, the paper illustrates the method with the case study of new biotechnology-based knowledge creation by firms in the foods sector. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Clusters are highly differentiated across sectors, regions and countries - both theoretical and empirical approaches, therefore, have to avoid universalization. Based on recent approaches, various forms of network relations and possible contents of interactions of firms connected with knowledge exchange are elaborated. It is argued that these interactions are distinctively structured, that the diffusion of knowledge is highly selective and strongly dependent on the position of firms within networks and on their absorptive capacity. By applying network analysis to different dimensions of interactions between firms, it is shown that physical linkages within the medium technology cluster under scrutiny are rather weak, that interactions based on different forms of knowledge exchange are denser, and that direct links to the science base seem to be more prominent than long-term supplier networks.","Institutions; Knowledge exchange; Network analysis; Regional networking","network analysis; networking; technology diffusion; technology transfer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, J.R., (1995) Learning and Memory.

The main purpose of this work is to show the relationship existing between the firm's absorptive capacity (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990) and knowledge transfer. To be able to measure the absorptive capacity, we focused on the role played by human resources in science, technology and innovation (HRISTI). For knowledge transfer analysis we have considered the cooperation projects for innovation performed by the companies as proxy indicators of knowledge interaction. The results obtained show that the patterns of knowledge interaction in the Basque firms are associated to their HRICTI profile.","Absorptive capacity; Cognitive proximity; Cooperation networks; Geographical proximity; Knowledge transfer; Organizational proximity; Qualified human resource",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Allen, J., Power/economic knowledge: Symbolic and spatial formations (2000) Knowledge, Space, Economic, pp. 15-33. , J.

The paper is based on the perspective that knowledge management is about continuously improving and benefiting from individual and organizational learning. Whereas in practice expatriates are increasingly recognized for their central role as knowledge-transfer agents, most theoretical discussions on knowledge management fail to consider the cross-national potentials. Previously expatriates primarily controlled and coordinated activities, but in the knowledge economy international assignments are increasingly seen as a way of obtaining knowledge-transfer. Operating internationally gives the organization a chance to create new expertise, and by transferring this expertise into the learning structure, it is most likely that the continued existence of the organization is ensured. Most of the knowledge acquired during a foreign assignment is tacit and therefore difficult to codify and transfer in a systematic way. Moreover, research shows that many repatriates leave their employer within few years after their return. This means that the important international knowledge which has been acquired during the time of expatriation often is not assimilated by the organization, as the tacit knowledge can only be transmitted by day-to-day applicability of skills and capabilities, by personal interaction among employees, and by observing the experienced employee. This paper discusses three important issues related to the issue of transferring knowledge. First, the paper combines theoretical literature on knowledge management with the importance of the expatriation mission as a learning opportunity. Next the concepts of organizational absorptive and individual disseminative capacity are introduced, as these capacities can affect the knowledge-transfer processes. Then, the paper discusses the benefits of knowledge networks in relation to the knowledge-transfer processes. Finally, the theoretical and managerial implications of the arguments are discussed, and a new line of future research is suggested.","Absorptive capacity; Disseminative capacity; Knowledge-transfer; Networks; Repatriation","Absorptive capacity; Conceptual development; Coordinated activity; Cross-national; Disseminative capacity; International assignments; Knowledge economy; Knowledge networks; Knowledge-transfer; Learning opportunity; Learning structure; Literature reviews; Managerial implications; Organizational learning; Personal interaction; Repatriation; Tacit knowledge; Networks (circuits); Knowledge management",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alavi, M., Leidner, D.E., Review: Knowledge Management and Knowledge Management Systems: Conceptual foundations and research issues (2001) MIS Quarterly, 25 (1), pp. 107-136; Bender, S., Fish, A., The Transfer of Knowledge and the Retention of Expertise: the continuing need for global assignments (2000) Journal of Knowledge Management, 4 (2), pp. 125-137; Black, J., Coming Home: The relationship of expatriate expectations with repatriation adjustment and job performance (1991) Academy of Management Proceedings, pp. 95-99; Bloodgood, J.M., Salisbury, W.D., Understanding the Interplay between Information Technology and Knowledge Management Strategies in Strategic Change Initiatives (2001) Decision Support Systems, 31, pp. 55-69; Bolino, M.C., Feldman, D.C., Increasing the Skill Utilization of Expatriates (2000) Human Resource Management, 39 (4), pp. 367-379; Bonache, J., Brewster, C., Knowledge Transfer and the Management of Expatriation (2001) Thunderbird International Business Review, 43 (1), pp. 145-168; Cabrera, E., Socio-Psychological Aspects of Knowledge Sharing in Organizations (2003) Proceedings of the 7th Conference on International Human Resource Management, , University of Limerick, Ireland; Caligiuri, P., Global Competence: What is it, and can it be developed through global assignments (2005) Human Resource Planning, 24 (3), pp. 27-35; Caligiuri, P.M., Santo, V.D., Global Competence: What is it and can it be developed through global assignments?

A secondary purpose is to evaluate the fit, suitability and applicability to this topic. Design/methodology/approach - A literature review on subsidiary learning and knowledge transfer in International Business and Economic Geography was conducted following an explorative design. Through a survey of articles on subsidiary learning sources, barriers, and the required mechanisms were identified. Some underlying theoretical contributions were also surveyed to better capture core constructs. Findings - Motivation, knowledge, absorptive capacity, and role of the subsidiary influence on learning, and the more embedded the subsidiary the better for performance. Furthermore, more advanced economies are expected to create more valuable knowledge, and knowledge flows therefore from advanced to transition economies. The more value-chain activities that are carried out, a greater flow of knowledge flow is expected. Not much research is conducted on the value of the knowledge flows. Subsidiary learning is not studied in transition economies by economic geographers, or international business researchers. Subsidiary learning is not studied in transition economies by economic geographers, or international business researchers. Research limitations/implications - Little knowledge exists on knowledge flows from subsidiaries in transition economies, to multinational corporation (MNC') entities in developed economies. Mapping of ongoing relations through the lenses of business networks may be one viable way to capture evolution and change in the role of subsidiaries, or it could be mapped through analysis of evolution and change in the routines between dyads in the MNC. Practical implications - MNCs may overlook learning opportunities due to biases in literature. Knowledge management and formal and informal integrative mechanisms for knowledge transfer may be as important in transition - as in developed economies. As Western firms continue to offshore critical activities to transition economies, they should explore the learning opportunities for organisational learning and improved strategic performance. Originality/value - The value of this paper lies in questioning the conventional knowledge on learning and knowledge transfer which is most often researched in developed economies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Knowledge transfer; Learning; Subsidiaries",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Almeida, P., Kogut, B., The localisation of knowledge and the mobility of engineers in regional networks (1999) Management Science, 45, pp. 905-917; Ambos, T.C., Ambos, B., Schlegelmilch, B.B., Learning from foreign subsidiaries: An empirical investigation of headquarters' benefit from reverse knowledge transfers (2006) International Business Review, 15, pp. 294-312; Andersson, U., Bjorkman, I., Forsgren, M., Managing subsidiary knowledge creation: The effect of control mechanisms on subsidiary local embeddedness (2005) International Business Review, 14, pp. 521-538; Andersson, U., Forsgren, M., Holm, U., Subsidiary embeddedness and competence development in MNCs - a multi-level analysis (2001) Organisational Studies, 22 (6), pp. 1013-1034; Andersson, U., Forsgren, M., Holm, U., The strategic impact of external networks: Subsidiary performance and competence development in the multinational corporation (2002) Strategic Management Journal, 23, pp. 979-996; Araujo, L., Rezende, S., Path dependence, MNCs and the internationalisation process: A relational approach (2003) International Business Review, 12, pp. 719-737; Bartlett, C.A., Ghosal, S., (1989) Managing Across Borders: The Transnational Solution, , Harvard Business School Press, Boston, MA; Bartlett, C.A., Ghosal, S., The multinational corporation as an interorganisational network (1990) Academy of Management Review, 15 (4), pp. 603-625; Birkinshaw, J., Entrepreneurship in multinational corporations: The characteristics of subsidiary initiatives (1997) Strategic Management Journal, 18, pp. 207-229; Birkinshaw, J., Hood, N., Multinational subsidiary evolution: Capability and charter change in foreign-owned subsidiary companies (1998) Academy of Management Review, 23 (4), pp. 773-795; Birkinshaw, J., Hood, N., Characteristics of foreign subsidiaries in industry clusters (2000) Journal of International Business Studies, 31 (1), pp. 141-154; Birkinshaw, J., Hood, N., Young, S., Subsidiary entrepreneurship, internal and external competitive forces, and subsidiary performance (2004) International Business Review, 14 (2), pp. 227-248; Blostermo, A., Eriksson, K., Lindstrand, A., Sharma, D.D., The perceived usefulness of network experiential knowledge in the internationalising firm (2004) Journal of International Management, 10, pp. 355-373; Chandler, A.D., Hagstroem, P., Solvell, O., (2001) The Dynamic Firm: The Role of Technology, Strategy, Organisation, and Regions, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Cohen, W., Levinthal, D., Absorptive capacity: A new perspective on learning and innovation (1990) Administrative Science, 35, pp. 128-152; Demeyer, A., Management of an international network of industrial R&D laboratories (1993) R&D Management, 23, pp. 109-121; Enright, M.J., Regional clusters and multinational enterprises.

However, limited research attention has been given to how the established antecedents of knowledge transfer are affected by the different forms that multi-organizational networks can assume. Using two case studies, we develop six testable propositions regarding how three of the established antecedents of knowledge transfer —absorptive capacity, shared identity and causal ambiguity—would be affected by the different characteristics, which define multi-organizational network form. We discuss these propositions and raise issues of relevance for researchers and practitioners. © 2007, IGI Global.

As discussed in Chap. 2, the latter involves a process of identifying, acquiring and using external knowledge. New product-developing small firms often need external knowledge due to the staff deficiencies and specialisation of these firms (see Chap. 1). In earlier chapters, it was shown that knowledge integration may be achieved by transferring explicit knowledge, and/or knowledge holders and that nurturing this process is important. This chapter shows that differences in knowledge and experience between a firm in need of external knowledge and the supplier of this knowledge are both a main source of advantage of knowledge transfer, as well as a barrier to successful transfer. It will be shown that, even if one knows which knowledge is needed, and where this knowledge is, an intensive process is needed to successfully implement external knowledge in an NPD process. The structure of the chapter follows this logic. The theoretical part (Sect. 9.2) shows that, considering the nature of knowledge and structures of networks especially in NPD processes, knowledge transfer involves methods of network management. The role of interaction in networks and the concept of absorptive capacity are described and ways to overcome these difficulties are outlined in the last part of the theory. The second part of the chapter (Sect. 9.3) describes the WAP case in which mechanisms of network-based knowledge transfer are illustrated. Conclusions for practice and research implications conclude this chapter. © Physica-Verlag Heidelberg 2006.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cohen, W.M., Levinthal, W.D., Absorptive capacity: A new perspective on learning and innovation (1990) Administrative Science Quarterly, 35, pp. 128-152; Gatignon, H., Robertson, T.S., A propositional inventory for new diffusion research, in (1985) Journal of Consumer Research, 11 (4), pp. 859-867; Granovetter, M., The strength of weak ties"" in (1973) American Journal of Sociology, 78, pp. 1360-1380; Granovetter, M., (1992) Problems of Explanation in Economic Sociology, , Nohria & Eccles; Groen, A.J., Knowledge intensive entrepreneurship in networks: A multi-level /multi dimensional approach based on social system theory (2005) Journal of Enterprising Culture, , In Press; Johnson, J.L., Kuehn, R., The small business owner/manager's search for external information (1987) Journal of Small Business Management, 25, pp. 53-60; (1999) Sleeping with the Enemy, , Klein Woolthuis Rosalinde PhD thesis.

Resource-and knowledge-based authors claim that firms should focus on the creation and accumulation of knowledge-based competencies in order to yield long-term survival. Several authors have emphasized the value addition of alliance relationships in the knowledge development and learning processes of organizations. Over the past decades, thanks to the opportunities provided by the inter-firm co-operations for knowledge transfer, knowledge access and learning, strategic alliances have become one of the most useful organizational form for creating new knowledge in technology, product and market development. This paper aims to identify and classify factors affecting knowledge transfer in strategic alliances. First, knowledge-related issues in strategic alliance literature are reviewed. Second, the importance of recognizing factors affecting knowledge transfer through strategic alliances is considered. Finally, the paper suggests a classification of factors that should be considered by alliance managers and all professionals involved in policy making, planning and executing inter-firm alliances. Four categories are distinguished: the characteristics of knowledge, the factors related to absorptive capacity, the reciprocal behavior of the partners, and finally, the nature and form of alliance activity.

It develops a conceptual framework, a methodology and a research agenda. The focus is on mapping and analyzing clustered firms and their linkages. Network analysis is proposed to find patterns of knowledge transfer and learning that differ according to firms ' absorptive capacities and the nature of the involved knowledge flows. System Dynamics modeling is then put forward in order to analyze within-cluster interactions as a series of knowledge stocks and knowledge flows. The goal is to assess the sustainability and stability of the cluster from a knowledge perspective (e.g. virtuous learning patterns), the effects of ICTon knowledge flows, and overall cluster performance. The paper provides a new perspective and a methodological approach to understand the dynamics of innovation in clusters and regional economies, and derive policy implications. © 2006 IEEE.",,"Clustered firms; Knowledge dynamics; Knowledge transfer; Regional economies; Data processing; Economics; Industrial research; Learning systems; Public policy; Societies and institutions; Knowledge engineering",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Krugman, P., (1991) Geography and Trade, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Porter, M., (1990) The Competitive Advantage of Nations, , New York: The Free Press; Audretsch, D.B., Feldman, M.P., R&D spillovers and the geography of innovation, and production (1996) American Economic Review, 83, pp. 630-638; Porter, M., Stern, S., Innovation: Location matters (2001) MIT Sloan Management Review, 42 (4), pp. 28-36. , Summer; Jaffe, A., Trajtenberg, M., Henderson, R., Geographical localisation of knowledge spillovers as evidenced by patent citations (1993) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 108, pp. 577-598. , 1993; Marshall, A., (1920) Industry and Trade, , London: Macmillan; Storper, M., The transition to flexible specialization in the U.S. film industry: External economies, division of labor, and the crossing of the industrial divides (1989) Cambridge Journal of Economics, 13, pp. 273-305; Hall, P., Markusen, A., (1985) Silicon Landscapes, , Boston, MA: Allen & Unwin; Arthur, B., Positive feedbacks in the economy (1990) Scientific American, 262 (2), pp. 92-99; (1992) Networks and Organizations: Structure, Form, and Action, , Nohria, N., and Ecoles, R., (eds.), Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Press; Powell, W., Neither market nor hierarchy: Network forms of organization (1987) Research in Organizational Behavior, , Staw, B., (ed.), Greenwich, CT: JAI Press; Saxenian, A., (1994) Regional Advantage: Culture and Competition in Silicon Valley and Route 128, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Holland, J., (1998) Emergence: From Chaos to Order, , Boston, MA: Addison-Wesley Longman Publishing Co., Inc; Anderson, P., Meyer, A., Eisenhardt, K., Carley, K., Pettigrew, A., Introduction to the special issue: Applications of complexity theory to organizational science (1999) Organization Science, 10, p. 3. , 1999; Argyris, C., Double loop learning in organizations (1977) Harvard Business Review, , Sept.-Oct; Kurtz, C.F., Snowden, D.J., The new dynamics of strategy: Sense-making in a complex and complicated world (2003) IBM Systems Journal, 42 (3); March, J., Exploration and exploitation in organizational learning (1991) Organization Science, 2, pp. 71-87. , 1991; Storper, M., Globalization and knowledge flows: An industrial geographer's perspective (2000) Regions, Globalization, and the Knowledge-based Economy, pp. 42-62. , Dunning, J.H., (ed.), Oxford, U.K.: Oxford University Press; Polanyi, M., (1958) Personal Knowledge, , London: Routledge and Kegan Paul; Nonaka, I., Takeuchi, H., (1995) The Knowledge-creating Company, , New York: Oxford University Press; Cohen, W.M., Levinthal, D.A., Absorptive capacity: A New perspective on learning and innovation (1990) Administrative Science Quarterly, 35; Zahra, S.A., George, G., Absorptive capacity: A review, reconceptualization, and extension (2002) Academy of Management Review, 27 (2), pp. 185-203; Allen, T.J., (1977) Managing the Flow of Technology: Technology Transfer and the Dissemination of Technological Information Within the R&D Organization, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Giuliani, E., Knowledge in the air and its uneven distribution: A story of a chilean wine cluster (2003) DRUID Winter Conference, , Aalborg, January; Roberts, J., From know-how to show-how: Questioning the role of information and communication technologies in knowledge transfer (2000) Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, 12 (4), pp. 429-443; Marwick, A.D., Knowledge management technology (2001) IBM Systems Journal, 40 (4), pp. 814-830; Wasserman, S., Faust, K., (2001) Social Network Analysis.

It opens an opportunity window for developing countries to learn from GPN. The paper proposes a 2-stage model describing the factors of knowledge transfer from global production flagships (GPF) to its participants in developing countries. In the first stage, there are two factors affecting the extent of knowledge from GPF to its participants: transfer activities and relationship between the two parties. In the second stage, knowledge from GPF, relative absorptive capacity and absorptive capacity of the local firm are considered as the three main factors affecting the efficiency of knowledge transfer. To test the model, we survey 105 manufacturing firms in China via questionnaires. Further, how the form to participate in GPN influences knowledge transfer is also examined. © 2006 IEEE.","Developing country; Global production network; Knowledge transfer","Data processing; Developing countries; Knowledge engineering; Production engineering; Societies and institutions; Global production network (GPN); Knowledge transfer; Information systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Xiaobo, W.; School of Management, , Hangzhou 310058, China",,"IEEE Engineering Management Society","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2006 IEEE International Engineering Management Conference, IEMC 2006 - Engineering Management: the Human Technology Interface","17 September 2006 through 20 September 2006","Salvador, Bahia",71447,,1424402867; 9781424402861,IEMCF,,"English","IEEE Int Eng Manage Conf",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39749166961

This study examines the influence of a network organization environment on the ability to develop agile adoption practices. An exploratory case study design was used to investigate the interactions between network structure, social information processing, organizational similarity (homophily), and absorptive capacity during the adoption of a large-scale IT system in two network organization environments within New York State. The data suggest that network organization characteristics and communication processes that reinforced social influence and supported knowledge transfer positively influenced adoption agility. We propose a model of agile adoption practices and discuss implications for the development of theory about network organization characteristics and capabilities to adopt IT-based innovations. © 2006 Operational Research Society Ltd.

Codifying tacit know-how helps, but codification becomes more challenging as the know-how changes more frequently. Transfer of tacit know-how becomes much more complicated when it changes often. We need more research in this area, particularly to help production and operations managers who must ultimately use the new know-how and change their companies' production processes. The paper suggests a framework as a step in that direction. The framework focuses on the interplay between the level of codification and the rate of change of production know-how, and identifies four zones for classifying production know-how: ""slow and codified,"" ""slow and tacit,"" ""fast and codified,"" and ""fast and tacit."" Examples from McDonald's, Club Med, Intel, and AOL are used to illustrate primary transfer mechanisms for each zone (manuals and systems, people, joint-development, and projects, respectively). Appropriate absorptive capacities in the production units for each zone are also identified. Since the ultimate responsibility of operations managers is to improve (i.e., change) their production know-how as fast as possible, they would be wise to adopt policies that are closer to those suited for the ""fast and codified"" zone.

To learn from the environment a firm must have access to external knowledge, and it must have the absorptive capacity to identify, assimilate and exploit such knowledge. While previous research recognized that firms must invest to acquire absorptive capacity, it assumed that access to knowledge spillovers is free, or a perfectly correlated component of R&D investments. We argue that a firm must also invest in developing organizational routines that search for and acquire access to knowledge spillover. In order to explore the relationship between own-knowledge development and search, we examine the relationship between software firms' R&D investments and their position within the patent citation network and their subsequent knowledge development and financial performance.

Alliances and networks. Strategic Management Journal 19, 293-317], has resulted in little attention being given to transaction costs and knowledge-based imperatives for alliance formation. In addition, Contractor and Ra (2002) [Contractor, F.J., Ra, W., 2002. How knowledge attributes influence alliance governance choices: a theory development note. Journal of International Management 8, 11-27] illustrated that theory on governance modal choice from the perspective of transactions costs and knowledge characteristics is underdeveloped, thereby proposing an interactive model predicting governance modal choice in an attempt to redress this imbalance. Using a multiple case study methodology the present study examines the important aspects of governance mode and knowledge exchange in strategic alliances between a multi-national corporation (MNC) and small and medium enterprises (SMEs). In doing so this paper qualifies the model proposed by Contractor and Ra (2002) [Contractor, F.J., Ra, W., 2002. How knowledge attributes influence alliance governance choices: a theory development note. Journal of International Management 8, 11-27], suggesting a model framing knowledge value as the primary predictor of governance modal choice as an appropriate framework to evaluate both the knowledge exchange relationships and governance modal choice relationships between MNCs and SMEs. Thus this paper advances theory on the motives for alliances, specifically, the effect on governance modal choice of a company's desire to acquire or access knowledge. In addition the paper furthers theory on organisational learning and absorptive capacity focusing on their influence on governance mode, in the context of management strategy. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

This paper reverses those perspectives. It examines the influence of individual firms' absorptive capacities on both the functioning of the intra-cluster knowledge system and its interconnection with extra-cluster knowledge. It applies social network analysis to identify different cognitive roles played by cluster firms and the overall structure of the knowledge system of a wine cluster in Chile. The results show that knowledge is not diffused evenly 'in the air', but flows within a core group of firms characterised by advanced absorptive capacities. Firms' different cognitive roles include some - as in the case of technological gatekeepers - that contribute actively to the acquisition, creation and diffusion of knowledge. Others remain cognitively isolated from the cluster, though in some cases strongly linked to extra-cluster knowledge. Possible implications for policy are noted. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Although Information Systems has confirmed that social influence factors play an important role in the adoption of technological innovations by individuals, less is understood about the mechanisms within social communication networks that facilitate the flow of social influence and knowledge and about the organizational capacity to acquire and absorb new knowledge. This exploratory study helps to specify interactions and feedback within social communication networks and organizational capacities in a network organization environment. We use an exploratory case study design to document how the flow of knowledge within social communication networks affected the adoption of a large-scale software system in several counties within New York state. Data from decision makers in two comparable network organizations were analyzed for differences in social communication networks and the organization's capability to absorb and exploit new knowledge. The data suggest that information system adoption was influenced by communication processes that reinforced social influences and supported knowledge transfer, and hampered when those processes were absent. Implications for the development of theory about the relationship between social information processing and the ability of an organization to absorb and adopt new technology are discussed. © 2005 by International Federation for Information Processing.

As a complement to previous research that has emphasized the dyadic tie strength component of informal networks, we focus on how network structure influences the knowledge transfer process. We propose that social cohesion around a relationship affects the willingness and motivation of individuals to invest time, energy, and effort in sharing knowledge with others. We further argue that the network range, ties to different knowledge pools, increases a person's ability to convey complex ideas to heterogeneous audiences. We also examine explanations for knowledge transfer based on absorptive capacity, which emphasizes the role of common knowledge, and relational embeddedness, which stresses the importance of tie strength. We investigate the network effect on knowledge transfer using data from a contract R&D firm. The results indicate that both social cohesion and network range ease knowledge transfer, over and above the effect for the strength of the tie between two people. We discuss the implications of these findings for research on effective knowledge transfer, social capital, and information diffusion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Argote, L., (1999) Organizational Learning: Creating, Retaining, and Transferring Knowledge, , Boston: Kluwer Academic; Argote, L., Beckman, S., Epple, D., The persistence and transfer of learning in industrial settings (1990) Management Science, 36, pp. 140-154; Argote, L., Ingram, P., Knowledge transfer: A basis for competitive advantage in firms (2000) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processing, 82, pp. 150-169; Argote, L., Ingram, P., Levine, J.M., Moreland, R.L., Knowledge transfer in organizations: Learning from the experience of others (2000) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 82, pp. 1-8; Argote, L., McEvily, B., Reagans, R., Managing knowledge in organizations: An integrative framework and review of emerging themes (2003) Management Science, 49, pp. 571-582; Arrow, K.J., (1974) The Limits of Organization, , New York: W.

Technology diffusion, in the form of new or improved technology, and the transmission of knowledge or technical expertise are considered. This involves spill-overs through formal and informal networks, enabling learning by interacting, and an absorptive capacity to assimilate new technology developed elsewhere. A temporal model of technology diffusion is developed including external sources, channels of technology transfer, and mechanisms involved in the transfer of technology into the innovative small firm. The model is related not only to ‘best practice’ but also to cases in which ‘low’ activity can be improved. The implications for policy relevant to technology and entrepreneurship that arise from the model are also investigated and conclusions are drawn. © 2001, © 2001 SAGE Publications.",,,,,,,"European Regional Development Fund, FEDER; European Regional Development Fund, FEDER","innovation needed to be answered.

Furthermore, a combination of network and BT-ratedeevelnts provided other Ž rms with the opportunity to add e-commerce to existing sales and marketing activities.

Data from 24 business units in a petrochemical company and 36 business units in a food-manufacturing company show that the interaction between absorptive capacity and network position has significant, positive effects on business unit innovation and performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., (1991) Multiple Regression: Testing and Interpreting Interactions, , Newbury Park, CA: Sage; Berger, P., Luckmann, T., (1966) The Social Construction of Reality: A Treatise in the Sociology of Knowledge, , Garden City, NY: Anchor Books; Borgatti, S.P., Everett, M.G., Freeman, L.C., (1992) UCINET IV Version 1.00, , Columbia, SC: Analytical Technologies; Burt, R.S., Positions in networks (1976) Social Forces, 55, pp. 93-122; Burt, R.S., Social contagion and innovation: Cohesion versus structural equivalence (1987) American Journal of Sociology, 92, pp. 1287-1335; Chow, G., Tests of equality between sets of coefficients in two linear regressions (1960) Econometrica, 28, pp. 591-605; Cohen, J., Cohen, P., (1983) Applied Multiple Regression/Correlation Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences (2nd Ed.), , Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum; Cohen, W., Levinthal, D., Absorptive capacity: A new perspective on learning and innovation (1990) Administrative Science Quarterly, 35, pp. 128-152; Coleman, J.S., (1990) Foundations of Social Theory, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Crossan, M.M., Lane, H.W., White, R.E., An organizational learning framework: From intuition to institution (1999) Academy of Management Review, 24, pp. 522-537; Dougherty, D., Hardy, C., Sustained product innovation in large, mature organizations: Overcoming innovation-to-organization problems (1996) Academy of Management Journal, 39, pp. 1120-1153; Freeman, L.C., Centrality in social networks: Conceptual clarification (1979) Social Networks, 1, pp. 215-239; Galbraith, J.R., (1977) Organizational Design, , Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley; Gresov, C., Stephens, C., The context of interunit influence attempts (1993) Administrative Science Quarterly, 38, pp. 252-276; Gupta, A.K., Govindarajan, V.G., Business unit strategy, managerial characteristics, and business unit level effectiveness at strategy implementation (1984) Academy of Management Journal, 27, pp. 25-41; Gupta, A.K., Govindarajan, V.G., Resource sharing among SBUs: Strategic antecedents and administrative implications (1986) Academy of Management Journal, 29, pp. 895-1714; Hansen, M.T., The search-transfer problem: The role of weak ties in sharing knowledge across organizational subunits (1999) Administrative Science Quarterly, 44, pp. 82-111; Hill, C.W.L., Hitt, M.A., Hoskisson, R.E., Cooperative versus competitive structures in related and unrelated diversified firms (1992) Organization Science, 3, pp. 501-521; Huber, G.P., Organizational learning: The contributing processes and the literatures (1991) Organization Science, 2, pp. 88-125; Ibarra, H., Network, centrality, power, and innovation involvement: Determinants of technical and administrative roles (1993) Academy of Management Journal, 36, pp. 471-501; James, L.R., Demaree, R.G., Wolf, G., rwg: An assessment of within-group interrater agreement (1993) Journal of Applied Psychology, 78, pp. 306-309; Kogut, B., Zander, U., Knowledge of the firm, combinative capacities and the replication of technology (1992) Organization Science, 3, pp. 383-397; Kraatz, M.S., Learning by association?
