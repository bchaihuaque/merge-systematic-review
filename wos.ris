AB  - We attempt to identify and measure knowledge spillovers in the French urban transport sector, which is strongly regulated and where a few large industrial groups are in charge of operating several urban networks. We build and estimate a structural cost model where the service is regulated by a local government and is provided by a single operator. Knowledge spillovers are directly linked to the know-how of a specific group, but they also depend on the incentive power of the regulatory contract which shapes the effort of the local managers. Exerting an effort in a specific network allows a cost reduction in this network, but it also benefits other networks that are members of the same group. We find that diversity of knowledge across operators of the same group improves absorptive capacity and increases the flow of spillovers. Simulation exercises provide evidence of significant reductions in total operating costs following the enlargement of industrial groups. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper takes a cross-level approach in contributing to defining the competences accumulated and shared in an industrial district, and to explaining how they differ from firm-specific, knowledge-based capacities. From a dataset of 952 Spanish firms and 35 industrial districts, we provide empirical evidence that industrial districts are spaces with dense networks of information and knowledge transfer, inter-personnel relationships and a strong specialised stock of human capital, which are accessible and shared by all firms embedded in such a district. However, we explain the complementarity between district and firm-specific capacities in order to develop the notion of absorptive capacity, by indicating that the diffusion of shared competences is neither easy nor direct and that it requires a firm's internal learning effort to better absorb localised knowledge spillovers. Results enable us to shed new light on how firms' knowledge creation and diffusion processes benefit from these external knowledge flows. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose - This study aims to address the performance consequences of knowledge transfer within related diversified firms by distinguishing between knowledge outflows and knowledge inflows at the business division level.
   Design/methodology/approach - Questionnaire data from a sample of 118 business divisions were analyzed using stepwise linear regression.
   Findings - The results from a three-effect model for the analysis of knowledge transfer indicate that knowledge outflow improves division performance, while knowledge inflow damages it when absorptive capacity is weak. The overall effect of knowledge transfer is therefore beneficial with the exception of the cases of receiving divisions with low levels of absorptive capacity.
   Practical implications - These results indicate that knowledge transfer contributes to overall corporate performance, since knowledge outflow impacts positively on division performance in all cases and knowledge inflow impacts negatively on division performance only in some cases. Setting aside the obvious task of promoting knowledge transfer within the firm, one important concern for corporate officers would be to prevent situations in which a division lacks the absorptive capacity to play its role within a corporate network.
   Originality/value - This work contributes to existent literature by disentangling the effects of knowledge transfer according to different theoretical perspectives, and it provides an empirical examination in a setting which is intensive in knowledge transference, as is that of business divisions from related diversified firms.

AB  - Firms need to develop knowledge to gain competitive advantage. However. merely possession of knowledge does not guarantee an edge in competition. In this paper, we operationalize the concept of disseminative capacity, analyze differences in disseminative capacity of network members and simulate dynamic behavioral patterns of intra-organization networks in knowledge transfer process. Theoretical analysis and simulation results convince us that absorptive capacity and disseminative capacity either interactively or separately determine how knowledge flows or is transferred effectively and efficiently between members of intra-organization networks. Results showed that knowledge equilibrium of networks over time depends on the size of network, knowledge transfer speed, and disserminative capabilities and absorptive capabilities of the individuals in the network. Moreover, the results showed that the more powerful is a dominant knowledge holder in the network, the quicker the network will converge to a specified knowledge state. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Recent extensions to the knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship (KSTE) show that the successful commercialization of new knowledge by incumbents depends on their absorptive capacities. For policy-makers focusing on increasing incumbents' innovative performance, the systematic reduction of knowledge filter through improved absorptive capacities thus becomes a crucial goal. While the general working mechanisms of knowledge filter have been analyzed within the KSTE framework, few institutional solutions to increase absorptive capacities have been put forth. This study provides an initial case study explaining a specific institutional framework fostering the systematic penetration of knowledge filters by incumbent firms in the case of German SMEs. Using a set of 177 in-depth interviews with firm representatives, the system of interrelated organizations, institutional arrangements, shared values, and economic incentives associated with the institutional structures for knowledge spillovers for German SMEs are described. I identify institutional characteristics connected to the dual system of vocational training, regulatory measures, and economic incentives mutually enforcing and fostering broad knowledge spillovers. This exploratory approach enables deriving hypotheses for the further study of knowledge filters as well as policy implications for the design of institutions increasing incumbents' absorptive capacities.

AB  - The present work aims at investigating under which circumstances University-Industry (UI) collaborations develop innovations whose spillovers are largely reused by other foreign firms in the development of subsequent and related innovations. In order to answer to this research question, we carried out several analyses from a sample of 772 joint patents in the pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and medical technology sectors, developed by German and Italian universities in collaboration with a firm. Our results show a positive effect of UI collaborations involving local partners, which encourage knowledge sharing and the adoption and combination of foreign knowledge by the same partners, which may complement knowledge and resources available at national level. Finally, we pointed out a positive moderating effect of university specialization, which may increase partners' absorptive capacity, hence favoring a more effective use of foreign knowledge. Our paper enables a better understanding of the determinants of the innovative impact of UI collaborations, by shedding new light on the mechanisms of global innovations systems that characterize the industries under analysis. Moreover, our work shows how innovation processes in these industries may be favored by adequate search strategies and the choice of effective university partners.

AB  - Do domestic firms benefit from the presence of foreign multinational firms? The FDI spillovers literature addresses this very issue, primarily examining whether the presence of foreign firms in a host market leads to technology spillovers and upgrading in domestic firms. A key finding is that spillovers depend on the absorptive capacity of the domestic firm. Yet, in conceptualizing absorptive capacity, scholars have largely overlooked how social structure shapes it. Integrating insights from social networks, technology upgrading, and innovation literatures, I emphasize that a domestic firm's ability to absorb spillovers depends on the social structure it is embedded in. I argue that ties with foreign firms reduce the constraints that domestic firms usually face in searching for and transferring in foreign technologies. However, while search benefits from sparse network structures, transfer is facilitated by cohesive ones. Also, while affect-based ties might motivate foreign firms sufficiently to share information with domestic firms at the search stage, reciprocal benefits and social monitoring conferred by common third-party ties are necessary in the transfer stage. Any effect of ties also depends on the routine repertoire of domestic firms. Put together, these arguments offer a more socialized account of the spillover process.

AB  - Knowledge transfer is an iterative process between knowledge senders and knowledge recipients Absorptive capacity of knowledge senders has been examined in the field of organizational learning and innovation literature, and many accumulated findings have emerged. However, absorptive capacity is necessary but not sufficient to full understanding of knowledge transfer. In this paper we argue that knowledge senders' disseminative capacity, i.e, the ability of knowledge holders to efficiently, effectively, and convincingly frame knowledge in a way that other people can Understand accurately and put into practice, plays an equally important role in knowledge transfer process. We examine this argument by employing a single-layer perceptron neural network model (SLPM) in a simulation study with two different network structures to get robust results. We demonstrate that both the disseminative capacity of knowledge senders and the absorptive capacity of knowledge recipients play important roles in knowledge transfer. Also, we found that the prominent knowledge holder plays a paramount role in knowledge transfer under quite different organizational structures. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Against a background of increasing international competition and rapid technological change, universities and industry have often engaged in collaboration as a means of improving cross-unit transfers of the resources, capabilities, and knowledge. Following this frontier, this study examines the effects of university and firm interpartner resource alignment and absorptive capacity on knowledge transfer performance from the university-industry (U-I) perspective. Regression analysis is used to test the hypotheses in a sample of 120 Taiwanese firms. The research findings suggest that, interpartner resource utilization is positively related to U-I interaction; that when the effect of a firm's absorptive capacity is higher, U-I interaction is more favorable; and that U-I interaction is positively related to knowledge transfer performance. Our empirical results support the process-oriented view and indicate that U-I interaction plays the mediating role between resource alignment, absorptive capacity and knowledge transfer performance. The implications of this study are two-fold. First, it emphasizes the value of creative financial and general performance in knowledge transfer by incorporating the U-I interaction perspective. Second, the research results offer support for suggestions that interpartner resource alignment provides a necessary element for capacity and resource exchange. Hence, one interesting further research would analyze practical cases of some Taiwanese companies with the described approach. This is an important practical issue that should be examined in the future.

AB  - We employed the grounded theory method to construct a framework describing the distinctive mechanisms through which big-science centers generate industrial knowledge spillovers in the economy. Our focus is on large-scale big-science installations typically associated with experimental physics. We draw on social network, social capital, and inter-organizational learning theories to examine knowledge spillovers accruing to industrial partner companies in big-science-industry dyads. The context for the study is provided by CERN's new particle accelerator project, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In addition to building a grounded theory framework for the study of industrial knowledge spillovers, our study demonstrates the distinctive potential that big-science centers offer as a source of knowledge spillovers in national innovation systems.

AB  - The majority of studies of knowledge spillovers from the presence of multinational corporations (MNCs) have focused on whether or not, rather than how knowledge spillovers occur from MNC subsidiaries to local host country firms. Using survey data from 210 MNC subsidiaries in Sweden, a composite model is developed examining the impact of two different environmental conditions on the occurrence of knowledge spillovers arising from innovation transfer within MNCs. We distinguish between horizontal knowledge spillovers (i.e., to competitors) and vertical knowledge spillovers (i.e., to customers and suppliers), and emphasise the conceptually important distinction between the two. The former are largely unintentional by nature whereas the latter can be considered as intentional knowledge diffusion. The results show that competitive pressure in the recipient subsidiary's local environment gives rise to unintentional knowledge spillovers, whereas it is negatively related to intentional knowledge diffusion. The results also support the notion that the degree of embeddedness of in a subsidiary's business network in the host country is positively related to intentional knowledge diffusion. An important finding of the study is that there is a positive relationship between intentional knowledge diffusion and unintentional knowledge spillovers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The networks emerge as a result of dynamic cooperation between firms occupying different locations in the knowledge space. Partner selection is driven by absorptive capacity which is itself influenced by cognitive distance and R&D investment allocation. Under different knowledge regimes, we examine the structure of networks that emerge and how firms perform within such networks. We find networks that exhibit small world properties which are generally robust to changes in the knowledge regime. Certain network strategies such as occupying brokerage positions or maximising accessibility to potential partners pay off, especially in 'young' industries with limited involuntary but abundant voluntary spillovers. This particular result is driven by endogenous absorptive capacity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article examines the ways that Australia's largest retail firms accessed and adapted external knowledge flows, largely from the USA, to develop discount department store chains from the late-1960s onwards. In doing so, it extends work on retail internationalisation by focusing on the importation, rather than the exportation of business models. The three firms - Coles, Myer and Woolworths - exhibited differing degrees of absorptive capacity in identifying and commercialising knowledge flows. This was reflected in fluctuating levels of success, the scope of store networks and relative positioning in the Australian market. Further, the role played by informal associations between managers in non-competing firms in different markets during the development of discount department stores in Australia advances the case for socialising analyses of business knowledge transfer more broadly.

AB  - In the paper, the concept of absorptive capacity, already successfully applied to firms, is extended to territories. Territory's Absorptive Capacity is here defined as the ability of a Region to identify, assimilate, and exploit external knowledge.
   From a theoretical point of view, the concept of Territory's Absorptive Capacity integrates two fields of studies, those of innovation systems and regional science.
   Three propositions are developed starting from the consideration that territory's absorptive capacity is dependent on increasing investments in human resource learning in a Region, promoting R&D activities and, above all, integrating knowledge flows through the action of territorial knowledge gatekeepers.

AB  - This paper assesses the extent to which absorptive capacity determines knowledge flows' impact on regional innovation. In particular, it looks at how regions with large absorptive capacity make the most of external inflows of knowledge and information brought in by means of inventor mobility and networks, and fosters local innovation. The paper uses an unbalanced panel of 274 regions over 8 years to estimate a regional knowledge production function with fixed-effects. It finds evidence that inflows of inventors are critical for wealthier regions, while it has more nuanced effects for less developed areas. It also shows that regions' absorptive capacity critically adds a premium to tap into remote knowledge pools conveyed by mobility and networks. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Past studies have suggested absorptive capacity plays very important role in knowledge transfer. However, less attention has been paid to the dual process of knowledge transfer, which covers knowledge dissemination and absorption. This study operationalizes the concept of disseminative capacity and analyses differences in disseminative capacity of network members. Theoretical analysis and simulation results showed that the sizes of network, knowledge transfer speed and disseminative capabilities and absorptive capabilities of the individuals in the network have effect on knowledge equilibrium of networks over time. Furthermore, the results showed that the more powerful is a dominant knowledge holder in the network, the quicker the network will converge to a specified knowledge state.

AB  - Technological advancement is an important instrument for economic and technological development, but most countries receive the benefits of innovation and new technologies through technology transfer. Previous studies typically consider direct linkages in order to understand technological advancement without paying much attention to indirect linkages, such as the inter-connectivity of the recipients of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). To understand the relationship between FDI and technological advancement and whether recipients' absorptive capacity matters, we model global FDI networks for the period 2009-2016. We find empirical evidence that the global FDI network has a core-periphery structure, and that core countries are more technologically developed than peripheral countries. We also find empirical evidence that a country's centrality of position in the global FDI network is positively associated with the technological advancement of a country, and that the absorptive capacity of a country can moderate this relationship. Regression analyses using instrumental variable estimators confirm the robustness of our findings. The most striking finding of our research is the strong moderation effect of knowledge intensity, a constituent of absorptive capacity. This finding provides a nuanced understanding of absorptive capacity, demonstrating the ways a country can benefit from FDI by reshaping the factors related to absorptive capacity.

AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to focus on knowledge transfer between the headquarters and a subsidiary of a multinational corporation (MNC). A framework with type of knowledge, absorptive capacity, disseminative capacity and tie strength is proposed. The framework is verified qualitatively and then further developed by adding another capacity needed by the headquarters: heeding capacity.
   Design/methodology/approach - To check the validity of the proposed conceptual framework empirically, interview-based qualitative studies were conducted for two partner programs implemented in the Japanese subsidiary of a US-based IT company. Interviews were undertaken with 17 respondents in the headquarters, the Japanese subsidiary and two alliance partners in Japan.
   Findings - It is confirmed that type of knowledge and absorptive capacity clearly affect the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. Also, it is found that the knowledge sender's disseminative capacity matters. Additionally, a case is found in which network ties mitigate the ineffectiveness caused by low disseminative/absorptive capacity.
   Research limitations/implications - In this research, cultural influences have not been considered. Also, this research has not paid attention to inter-organizational knowledge transfer. These provides potential for further research which could explore this complexity in more depth.
   Practical implications - It is suggested that the headquarters of a MNC need to have a "heeding capacity" in cases where the target subsidiary's disseminative capacity is low and tie strength between the subsidiary and the headquarters is weak. It is a capacity for the headquarters to heed what a subsidiary would like to transmit but cannot do well, and this is achieved by listening carefully and not letting language barriers or cultural differences obfuscate the meaning.
   Originality/value - By focusing on a dyad between the headquarters and the Japanese subsidiary, the importance of disseminative capacity of a subsidiary is highlighted, which is not often the case in the extant literature. Also, headquarters' heeding capacity is proposed.

Findings show that the multi-disciplinary nature of the recipient team improved absorptive capacity efficacy because it reduced knowledge ambiguity as well as knowledge distance. This study also points out the role of residual knowledge to absorptive capacity efficacy, as well as the amplifying influence of means and media that complement absorptive capacity efficacy and lower the influence of contingency factors such as physical, institutional, and cultural detachments.

AB  - Absorptive capacity is a firm's ability to value, assimilate, and utilize new external knowledge and apply it to commercial ends. Much of the prior research on absorptive capacity focuses on characterizing the factors that influence absorptive capacity within organizations. However, the mechanism of how related factors affect absorptive capacity across interdependent organizations in project networks remains less explored. This paper extends a simulation model of project network learning to explore the absorptive capacity of project networks where periodic external innovations exist. This model is utilized in a series of simulation experiments to untangle the effects of varying types of innovation and degrees of relational instability in a project network. We establish a measure of project network absorptive capacity and develop an argument that relational instability moderates the project network's absorptive capacity for different types of innovation. These findings have significant implications for assessing and developing strategies to improve a project organizational network's capacity to absorb and, hence, profit from innovation.

AB  - The extant literature has highlighted the importance of knowledge transfer between a buyer and its supply network for strengthening supply chain competence. This is a bi-directional exchange where the buyer and supply network each act as the sender and receiver of knowledge. Prior research has however largely focused on the knowledge recipient only. We consider both sender and recipient using two key dynamic capabilities related to knowledge transfer: (i) desorptive capacity, which enables the safe transfer of knowledge from the sender; and, (ii) absorptive capacity, which enables the acquisition and assimilation of external knowledge by the recipient. Using the concept of 'fit', we investigate whether organisations strengthen supply chain competence when their desorptive capacity exceeds that of their supply network's (positive misfit) and consider the moderating role of the organisation's and supply network's absorptive capacity. Multiple regression analysis of survey data from 250 firms identifies an inverted U-shaped relationship between positive desorptive capacity misfit and supply chain competence. Further, this relationship is shown to be moderated by the supply network's absorptive capacity level. The paper furthers our understanding of supply chain knowledge management enabling buyers and their supply networks to achieve more successful knowledge transfer outcomes.

AB  - Usually, knowledge spillovers (KS) are related to geographic proximity. In the present study, we measure KS on the basis of different proximity matrices, focusing on the relational, social, cognitive and technological preconditions for knowledge diffusion. In the light of previous studies on KS, we examine: (i) which types of proximity enhance or hamper knowledge flows, and (ii) whether local absorptive capacity favour such flows. Our results indicate that KS across European NUTS2 regions measured through geographic, relational, social, cognitive and technological proximity channels increase with local absorptive capacity. This finding points towards the emergence of large clusters of regions (absorptive capacity clubs) where relational, cognitive, social and technological proximity lock-in maximizes the returns to local investment in R&D.

AB  - Purpose
   This study aims to address the relevance of the mediating role of the relative absorptive capacity (ACAP-R) in the relation between absorptive capacity and innovation, contributing to a better understanding of innovation in a business network. Participants' firms in this study are part of the supply network of an automotive cluster.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The study is developed in 225 companies that are part of the supply network of an automotive cluster in Mexico. A survey was applied to key firm informants who had been involved on processes of innovation, quality or continuous improvement. During data analysis, structural equation modeling was implemented with the support of SmartPLS 3.0 to understand the mediation role of relative absorptive capacity as a novel insight of innovation in a Mexican cluster.
   Findings
   The results demonstrate the partial mediator role of the ACAP-R among the absorptive capacities and the level of innovation of the companies that make up the network studied. The findings represent an approach to the understanding of one of the key dynamic capacities in the innovation process and, thus, to the competitiveness of organizations, which has scarcely been studied from the perspective of business networks.
   Originality/value
   The findings provide useful insights not only in terms of understanding the link between absorptive capacity and innovation, but also how to improve levels of innovation through knowledge exchanges that occur during the participation of suppliers and customers in a business network. Firms with high levels of ACAP are more likely to recognize the opportunity to benefit from external knowledge and to participate intensely in collaborative efforts. That is, technological similarity or similar knowledge base between source or recipient firms impacts their innovation.

AB  - From a knowledge-processing perspective, this study presents an integrative conceptual framework to analyse the roles of innovation intermediaries within knowledge systems of industrial clusters. The empirical basis of the conceptual framework is demonstrated with an in-depth case study of Zhejiang Institute of Modern Textile Industry, an innovation intermediary that greatly facilitates knowledge spillover, application and integration in the Shaoxing Textile industrial cluster in China. This case analysis shows that an innovation intermediary can play the roles of technology gatekeeper, technology spanner, technical problem solver, and innovation resource integrator within the knowledge system of an industrial cluster. In addition, examining the process of intermediation reveals that absorptive capacity, knowledge complexity, presence of a structural hole and network centrality are critical to the role in which innovation intermediaries function within the knowledge systems of industrial clusters.

AB  - Managerial ties-the boundary-spanning ties and interpersonal connections of top managers-contribute to a corporation's innovativeness in emerging economies because of the absence of market supporting institutions, transparent laws, and clear regulations. Moreover, managerial ties are apt to interact with absorptive capacity to facilitate knowledge sharing and innovation. This paper examines the joint influence of managerial ties and absorptive capacity in two communities in China, one characterized by a high level of foreign direct investment (FDI) and the other consisting mainly of local corporations. We find that absorptive capacity moderates the effect of managerial ties on a corporation's innovativeness. Furthermore, when examining the two communities separately, we find that business ties and university ties have opposite effects.

Regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses in a sample of 137 alliance cases. The findings suggest that knowledge transfer performance is positively affected by the explicitness of knowledge and firm's absorptive capacity; that equity-based alliance will transfer tacit knowledge more effectively while contract-base alliance is more effective for the transfer of explicit knowledge; and that trust and adjustment have positive effects while conflict possesses a curvilinear effect on knowledge transfer performance.

AB  - Absorptive capacity may be defined as a dynamic capability that allows firms to recognise the value of new external knowledge, assimilate and apply it with commercial purposes. It is a multidimensional construct whose dimensions are generally considered as knowledge acquisition, assimilation, transformation and application. Nevertheless, there are a number of ambiguities about the own concept, which make it difficult the depiction of the knowledge absorption process and its dimensions. Therefore, this paper revises the main contributions on this topic and construct, along with its antecedents and consequences. Based on this review, we develop a number of theoretical ideas and we propose a new configuration for knowledge absorptive process. This new model stresses the importance of knowledge identification and understanding process as previous stage for knowledge acquisition and its role in the entire absorptive process.

AB  - In this paper, we examine the role of firms' absorptive capacity in industry-university collaboration and, in particular, whether absorptive capacity moderates the effects of university collaboration on firms' innovativeness. Having defined absorptive capacity as the recognition, assimilation and application of valuable external knowledge for commercial purposes, we formulated three hypotheses pertaining to firm innovativeness and tested them in an original survey comprising a representative multi-industry sample of 1,532 Swedish firms. The results suggest that benefiting from university cooperation is conditional upon the firm's level of absorptive capacity. At low levels of absorptive capacity, engaging with universities does not translate into any noticeable increase in innovative output. In contrast, medium to high levels of absorptive capacity is where a firm benefit most from collaborating with a university. We also show that these effects are more pronounced for firms operating in sectors characterised by lower levels of technology and knowledge intensity.

AB  - Knowledge acquired through external network relationships is widely accepted as one of the most important resources for a firm to be innovative. This is especially true for the networked tourism industry, where capabilities associated with the acquisition, assimilation and exploitation of external knowledge ('absorptive capacity') are paramount. While several studies highlight the importance of network relationships to acquire new knowledge, most of them remain vague in explaining their impact on the assimilation and exploitation of the knowledge. This paper investigates the impacts of network relationships on absorptive capacity dimensions. A quantitative survey among 378 hotel businesses was carried out to measure network participation and relationship quality as well as the absorptive capacity. Regression models reveal that the quality of external relationships and the overall network size implicate access and availability of valuable knowledge and positively affect the organization's capacity to assimilate and exploit the knowledge in pursuit of innovation.

AB  - The concept of absorptive capacity has already been considerably studied from a theoretical perspective, but few, if any, attempts at operationalizing the concept have been studied in ways that would allow its full assessment. The more specific focus provided by the four dimensions identified in some recent literature - acquisition, assimilation, transformation and exploitation - opens up some promising avenues for operationalizing the concept. This exploratory research studies and describes case studies of ten innovative companies using a cross-sectional research design. In the first part of the article, we re-examine the concept of absorptive capacity in terms of dynamic capabilities and provide a review of the relevant literature. The second part describes the work accomplished to operationalize the concept of dynamic capability and analyses the possible relationship between the business strategies adopted by the companies studied and their particular strategic capacity.

AB  - Through the lens of social capital perspective, this paper assesses how individuals' interactions and their learning capabilities explain the transfer of good practices in an interorganizational network. Primary data were collected from export consortia in Tunisia through a questionnaire survey. The research underlines the impact of the strength and the range of ties between managers. It is also found that managers' absorptive capacity moderates the impact of the strength of ties. This study considers the individual's behavior at the heart of the knowledge transfer process and suggests a substitution effect between the strength of social ties and individual's absorptive capacity.

AB  - Absorptive capacity is a common barrier to knowledge transfer at the individual level. However, technology absorptive capacity can enhance an individual's learning behaviour. This study investigates that technology readiness, the tools for knowledge sources, social influences, and social networks influence an individual's absorptive capacity on an adaptation of the individual learning behaviour. A quantitative approach is used to assess the presence of a causal relationship from the constructs mentioned above. Data were collected from university students in Australia to examine the hypotheses. With 199 responses, a partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) approach was used for the analysis. The results generated mixed findings. Individual's technological belief in optimism and innovation and social influences had a significantly weaker effect on individual absorptive capacity, which in turn had a significantly weaker impact on their learning behaviour.

By incorporating four different facets (i.e., absorption, sharing, implanting, and application of market knowledge) of the phenomenon, we draw new insights into RKT. Through empirically testing the phenomenon in the Korean context, we reveal that market knowledge absorption by subsidiaries is a critical component that influences the knowledge integration mechanisms (KIMs) within MNC networks. Furthermore, KIMs within MNC networks are primary keys for absorptive capacity (AC) of HQs and knowledge relevance between HQs and subsidiaries. Our results extend our understanding of RKT, while also offering useful implications for MNCs that intend to establish subsidiaries in foreign markets. Copyright (c) 2016 ASAC.

AB  - This study examines the extent to which the intra-industry knowledge spillover and a firm's alliance portfolio diversity have an effect on product innovation performance and the growth of different size of firms. A model was proposed and empirically tested using structural equation modelling with Bayesian estimation. The data was extracted from the Colombian innovation survey EDIT from 2011 to 2016 and comprised a sample of 913 manufacturing firms. The results demonstrated that less-developed and resource-scarce settings, such as Colombia, foster interfirm collaboration regardless of their size. Nevertheless, even when considered the positive and significant effect of collaboration, spillovers are the most relevant external knowledge source in explaining the product innovation performance and growth of small and medium firms. The findings also showed that knowledge spillovers can be detrimental to the large firms' outcomes, possibly associated with a weaker appropriability regime and the loss of knowledge derived from outgoing spillovers.

AB  - A firm's absorptive capacity involves two dimensions: horizontal and vertical. The horizontal dimension refers to a dynamic interplay between internal and external environments of the firm, which is extensively covered in the absorptive capacity research. However, the literature ignores vertical dimension involving individual-organization interactions. Scant knowledge is available about the mechanisms through which absorptive capacity emerges as an organizational learning capability. This study reviews the seminal works of Cohen and Levinthal and finds that the stickiness of knowledge, the multiple antecedents of absorptive capacity and their interattions are explicitly addressed therein, but are insufficiently problematized in subsequent research. Drawing on the knowledge-based view of the firm and the micro-foundations lens of organizational capabilities, the present study re-conceptualizes absorptive capacity as a set of three sequentially linked learning processes where individual and organizational antecedents interact, and explains how value recognition, assimilation and application capabilities emerge as organizational (macro) level phenomena.

AB  - How to realize the sustainable development of the industry-university-research institute (IUR) collaboration innovation ecosystem has become a key factor restricting the independent innovation capability of Chinese enterprises. Knowledge transfer performance is a key consideration in the process of R&D collaboration between companies and research institutes; how to improve the performance of knowledge transfer depends on the matching between the partners of IUR collaboration. This article seeks to explore the influence mechanism of partner differences in the industry-university-research institute collaboration on the performance of knowledge transfer from the perspective of enterprises. Specifically, the study explores the moderating effect of technical knowledge difference and goal difference on the relationship between absorptive capacity, learning willingness, and knowledge transfer performance. The study applied the partial least squares structural equation modeling approach to model these relationships, based on survey data gathered from 211 Chinese firms. The results show that the goal difference of industry-university-research institute collaboration partners has a negative moderating effect on the relationship between learning willingness, absorptive capacity, and knowledge transfer performance. The greater the degree of goal difference, the lower the role of the enterprise's learning willingness and absorptive capacity to promote knowledge transfer performance. Technical knowledge difference has a significant inverted U-shaped effect on the relationship between absorptive capacity and knowledge transfer performance: a high degree of technical knowledge difference weakens the effects of absorptive capacity on knowledge transfer performance, while a low degree of technical knowledge difference will also negatively moderate the effects of absorptive capacity on knowledge transfer performance. The research conclusions provide scientists, government bodies, and decision makers with the necessary information for a better understanding of the effective mechanism of sustainable knowledge transfer in the IUR innovation ecosystem.

AB  - The purpose of this perspective paper is to advance understanding of absorptive capacity, its underlying dimensions, its multilevel antecedents, its impact on firm performance, and the contextual factors that affect absorptive capacity. Twenty years after the Cohen and Levinthal 1990 paper, the field is characterized by a wide array of theoretical perspectives and a wealth of empirical evidence. In this paper, we first review these underlying theories and empirical studies of absorptive capacity. Given the size and diversity of the absorptive capacity literature, we subsequently map the existing terrain of research through a bibliometric analysis. The resulting bibliometric cartography shows the major discrepancies in the organization field, namely that (1) most attention so far has been focused on the tangible outcomes of absorptive capacity; (2) organizational design and individual level antecedents have been relatively neglected in the absorptive capacity literature; and (3) the emergence of absorptive capacity from the actions and interactions of individual, organizational, and interorganizational antecedents remains unclear. Building on the bibliometric analysis, we develop an integrative model that identifies the multilevel antecedents, process dimensions, and outcomes of absorptive capacity as well as the contextual factors that affect absorptive capacity. We argue that realizing the potential of the absorptive capacity concept requires more research that shows how "micro-antecedents" and " macro-antecedents" influence future outcomes such as competitive advantage, innovation, and firm performance. In particular, we identify conceptual gaps that may guide future research to fully exploit the absorptive capacity concept in the organization field and to explore future fruitful extensions of the concept.

AB  - Objective: The main objective of the article is to examine the effect of organisational learning orientation (OLO) and absorptive capacity (AC) on innovation capability (IC).
   Research Design & Methods: The hypotheses were tested on a sample of 239 respondents. Hypotheses were verified by means of structural equation modelling (SEM), using the asymptotically distribution-free method (ADF).
   Findings: A change in organisational learning orientation brings about changes in absorptive capacity, which in turn influences business innovation capability. Absorptive capacity is affected mostly by two dimensions of organisational learning orientation: commitment to learning (OLO1) and open-mindedness (OLO3). In turn, absorptive capacity affected by organisational learning orientation has the strongest impact on product innovation (IC1), a lesser impact on process innovation (ICA2), and the weakest impact on managerial innovation (IC3). Moreover, the process of knowledge sharing (KS) mediates the effect of absorptive capacity on each of the dimensions of innovation capability.
   Implications & Recommendations: First, this study expands our understanding of the effect of learning orientation on absorptive capacity. Second, it confirms the presence of a statistically significant and positive relationship between absorptive capacity and innovation capability. The third implication concerns the indirect dependencies between absorptive capacity and innovation capability.
   Contribution & Value Added: The study identifies and examines mechanisms that support the transformation of external knowledge - already acquired and used by an organisation - into innovations.

AB  - University Spin-Offs (USOs) are actively involved in the knowledge spillover process and fully integrated in the regional innovation systems. Drawing on the Knowledge Spillover Theory of Entrepreneurship and using a multilevel approach of analysis, we explore whether the region's knowledge spillover and the firm's absorptive capacity jointly determine the innovative performance of USOs. At regional level, technological spillovers, production spillovers, and human capital spillovers have been considered. The results from a cross-national panel sample of 401 and 711 Spanish and Italian USOs, over the period 2005-13 and located in twenty-two administrative regions, show that only the production spillovers have a significant positive effect on the USO's innovative activity. Firm-specific characteristics are important for explaining USOs' innovation. More specifically, firm age has a negative effect, while firm size seems to have a positive effect. Additionally, USOs active in high-tech sectors seem to perform better in their innovation activity.

Results show that while human capital-enhancing HR (acquisition and developmental HR) is positively related to absorptive capacity, social capital-enhancing HR affects absorptive capacity through egalitarian HR practices. Organization capital-enhancing HR practices contribute to absorptive capacity through effective information systems. Finally, our findings confirm that the various intellectual capital-enhancing HR practices affect innovation performance through their impact on the firm's absorptive capacity.

AB  - This paper provides the profiling on the 'relative absorptive capacity of knowledge' research to provide insights of the field based on data collected from the ISI Web of science database during the years 2001-2010. The analysis is established in three phases, namely, the general publication, the subject area, and the topic profiling. The study obtains patterns, characteristics, and attributes at country, institutions, journals, author, and core reference levels. It shows the increase of the research activity in the field, based on the publication productivity during the years mentioned. Most of these publications are classified in the subject areas of business and economics, engineering, and operations research and management science. We highlight the nascent interest of the computer science subject area as a way to operationalize the different studies conducted. We found a lack of contribution from African and Latin-American countries despite the importance of the field for them. Our results are useful in terms of science strategy, science and technology policy, research agendas, research alliances, and research networks according to the special interest of specific actors at the individual, institutional, and national levels.

AB  - The development of clusters rests on geographical proximity, cognitive interactions as well as entrepreneurial initiatives. Sophia Antipolis, a multi-technology cluster in Valbonne, France, is a good illustration of the type of challenges local systems of innovation face in creating positive knowledge externalities. This paper shows that if the existence of 'gatekeepers of knowledge' can generate the potential implementation of 'absorptive capacity', its effective realization requires some additional effort regarding the transfer of knowledge into the cluster. The concept of 'platform of knowledge' defined shows how a project of knowledge codification could generate externalities by creating new opportunities for effectively combining and absorbing knowledge.

AB  - The main objective of this study is to answer the question of how farmers' networking behaviour and their ability to acquire, assimilate, transform and exploit external knowledge is related to their level of innovativeness and profitability. These relations were tested on the basis of structural equation modeling using 444 questionnaires completed by large-scale pig farmers in the Netherlands. Previous studies on the relation between network structure and innovativeness retained the absorptive capacity 'black box' by using proxies for absorption of knowledge. The present study addresses this shortcoming by studying absorptive capacity in terms of organizational capacities (routines and processes) of farmers to use their networks and absorb external knowledge. The findings show that frequency of contact in a specific network range affects innovativeness positively, but also indirectly through acquisition and assimilation capacity. Assimilation capacity turns out to be the most important dimension of absorptive capacity for the innovativeness of pig farmers.

AB  - This paper analyzes the impact of knowledge spillovers on firm performance measured through total sales, the percentage of innovative sales and a categorical variable that classifies firms into three different groups depending on the stage of their sales growth evolution: upturn, downturn, or transition. We specifically focus on whether there are asymmetric spillover effects depending on the intermediary role of firms' technological relatedness, which we proxy by the use of external sources of knowledge. Using data on 5900 Spanish firms for the period 2004-2016, we find that spillover effects from intra-sector and upstream knowledge pools are-in general-positive, although with some differences depending on the measure of firm performance and on the moderating role of technological networking. Our results also suggest the presence of a "business stealing effect" in environments with a high proportion of knowledge-based gross added value. Furthermore, we find that spillover effects are asymmetric depending on the firm's size and intensity of R&D employment. Knowledge spillovers seem to play a more significant role in the case of SMEs than in large companies, and firms with high intensities of R&D employment benefit more from upstream spillovers and less from horizontal spillovers than firms with low intensities.

AB  - The study investigates how a multinational corporation (MNC) can promote the absorptive capacity of its subsidiaries. The focus is on what drives the MNC subsidiary's ability to absorb marketing strategies that are initiated by the MNC parent, as well as how the subsidiary enacts on this absorptive capacity in order to compete in its focal market. The dual embeddedness of MNC subsidiaries plays a key role in this investigation, as subsidiaries belong to the MNC network and are simultaneously embedded in their host country environment. We argue that subsidiary absorptive capacity is formed as a purposeful response to this dual embeddedness. An analysis of marketing strategy absorptions undertaken by 213 subsidiaries reveals that MNCs can assist their subsidiaries to compete in competitive and dynamic focal markets by forming specific organizational mechanisms that are conducive to the development of subsidiary absorptive capacity. The findings hold important theoretical and practical implications.

AB  - This paper has as its aim to analyse multinational enterprises' location decisions from the perspective of the knowledge-based firm in an attempt to answer the following questions: Are innovative MNEs more likely to be located in areas with a higher degree of agglomeration? Who benefits to a greater extent - in terms of innovation - from geographical proximity with other agents: national or foreign enterprises? What role does absorptive capacity play in the relationship between agglomeration and innovation? According to this research work, agglomeration differently influences the innovation of MNE subsidiaries - through knowledge spillovers - depending on the types of agglomerated companies. The analysis performed with a sample of firms located in Spain includes local and foreign companies and uses data from a survey conducted by the National Statistics Institute (INE for its Spanish initials) in 2016. The results show that the agglomeration of similar enterprises favours innovation amongst foreign firms, as opposed to local ones, which absorb both positive and negative effects.
