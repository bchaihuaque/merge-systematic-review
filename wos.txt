AB We attempt to identify and measure knowledge spillovers in the French urban transport sector, which is strongly regulated and where a few large industrial groups are in charge of operating several urban networks. We build and estimate a structural cost model where the service is regulated by a local government and is provided by a single operator. Knowledge spillovers are directly linked to the know-how of a specific group, but they also depend on the incentive power of the regulatory contract which shapes the effort of the local managers. Exerting an effort in a specific network allows a cost reduction in this network, but it also benefits other networks that are members of the same group. We find that diversity of knowledge across operators of the same group improves absorptive capacity and increases the flow of spillovers. Simulation exercises provide evidence of significant reductions in total operating costs following the enlargement of industrial groups. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper takes a cross-level approach in contributing to defining the competences accumulated and shared in an industrial district, and to explaining how they differ from firm-specific, knowledge-based capacities. From a dataset of 952 Spanish firms and 35 industrial districts, we provide empirical evidence that industrial districts are spaces with dense networks of information and knowledge transfer, inter-personnel relationships and a strong specialised stock of human capital, which are accessible and shared by all firms embedded in such a district. However, we explain the complementarity between district and firm-specific capacities in order to develop the notion of absorptive capacity, by indicating that the diffusion of shared competences is neither easy nor direct and that it requires a firm's internal learning effort to better absorb localised knowledge spillovers. Results enable us to shed new light on how firms' knowledge creation and diffusion processes benefit from these external knowledge flows. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose - This study aims to address the performance consequences of knowledge transfer within related diversified firms by distinguishing between knowledge outflows and knowledge inflows at the business division level.
   Design/methodology/approach - Questionnaire data from a sample of 118 business divisions were analyzed using stepwise linear regression.
   Findings - The results from a three-effect model for the analysis of knowledge transfer indicate that knowledge outflow improves division performance, while knowledge inflow damages it when absorptive capacity is weak. The overall effect of knowledge transfer is therefore beneficial with the exception of the cases of receiving divisions with low levels of absorptive capacity.
   Practical implications - These results indicate that knowledge transfer contributes to overall corporate performance, since knowledge outflow impacts positively on division performance in all cases and knowledge inflow impacts negatively on division performance only in some cases. Setting aside the obvious task of promoting knowledge transfer within the firm, one important concern for corporate officers would be to prevent situations in which a division lacks the absorptive capacity to play its role within a corporate network.
   Originality/value - This work contributes to existent literature by disentangling the effects of knowledge transfer according to different theoretical perspectives, and it provides an empirical examination in a setting which is intensive in knowledge transference, as is that of business divisions from related diversified firms.

AB Firms need to develop knowledge to gain competitive advantage. However. merely possession of knowledge does not guarantee an edge in competition. In this paper, we operationalize the concept of disseminative capacity, analyze differences in disseminative capacity of network members and simulate dynamic behavioral patterns of intra-organization networks in knowledge transfer process. Theoretical analysis and simulation results convince us that absorptive capacity and disseminative capacity either interactively or separately determine how knowledge flows or is transferred effectively and efficiently between members of intra-organization networks. Results showed that knowledge equilibrium of networks over time depends on the size of network, knowledge transfer speed, and disserminative capabilities and absorptive capabilities of the individuals in the network. Moreover, the results showed that the more powerful is a dominant knowledge holder in the network, the quicker the network will converge to a specified knowledge state. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recent extensions to the knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship (KSTE) show that the successful commercialization of new knowledge by incumbents depends on their absorptive capacities. For policy-makers focusing on increasing incumbents' innovative performance, the systematic reduction of knowledge filter through improved absorptive capacities thus becomes a crucial goal. While the general working mechanisms of knowledge filter have been analyzed within the KSTE framework, few institutional solutions to increase absorptive capacities have been put forth. This study provides an initial case study explaining a specific institutional framework fostering the systematic penetration of knowledge filters by incumbent firms in the case of German SMEs. Using a set of 177 in-depth interviews with firm representatives, the system of interrelated organizations, institutional arrangements, shared values, and economic incentives associated with the institutional structures for knowledge spillovers for German SMEs are described. I identify institutional characteristics connected to the dual system of vocational training, regulatory measures, and economic incentives mutually enforcing and fostering broad knowledge spillovers. This exploratory approach enables deriving hypotheses for the further study of knowledge filters as well as policy implications for the design of institutions increasing incumbents' absorptive capacities.

AB The present work aims at investigating under which circumstances University-Industry (UI) collaborations develop innovations whose spillovers are largely reused by other foreign firms in the development of subsequent and related innovations. In order to answer to this research question, we carried out several analyses from a sample of 772 joint patents in the pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and medical technology sectors, developed by German and Italian universities in collaboration with a firm. Our results show a positive effect of UI collaborations involving local partners, which encourage knowledge sharing and the adoption and combination of foreign knowledge by the same partners, which may complement knowledge and resources available at national level. Finally, we pointed out a positive moderating effect of university specialization, which may increase partners' absorptive capacity, hence favoring a more effective use of foreign knowledge. Our paper enables a better understanding of the determinants of the innovative impact of UI collaborations, by shedding new light on the mechanisms of global innovations systems that characterize the industries under analysis. Moreover, our work shows how innovation processes in these industries may be favored by adequate search strategies and the choice of effective university partners.

AB Do domestic firms benefit from the presence of foreign multinational firms? The FDI spillovers literature addresses this very issue, primarily examining whether the presence of foreign firms in a host market leads to technology spillovers and upgrading in domestic firms. A key finding is that spillovers depend on the absorptive capacity of the domestic firm. Yet, in conceptualizing absorptive capacity, scholars have largely overlooked how social structure shapes it. Integrating insights from social networks, technology upgrading, and innovation literatures, I emphasize that a domestic firm's ability to absorb spillovers depends on the social structure it is embedded in. I argue that ties with foreign firms reduce the constraints that domestic firms usually face in searching for and transferring in foreign technologies. However, while search benefits from sparse network structures, transfer is facilitated by cohesive ones. Also, while affect-based ties might motivate foreign firms sufficiently to share information with domestic firms at the search stage, reciprocal benefits and social monitoring conferred by common third-party ties are necessary in the transfer stage. Any effect of ties also depends on the routine repertoire of domestic firms. Put together, these arguments offer a more socialized account of the spillover process.

AB Knowledge transfer is an iterative process between knowledge senders and knowledge recipients Absorptive capacity of knowledge senders has been examined in the field of organizational learning and innovation literature, and many accumulated findings have emerged. However, absorptive capacity is necessary but not sufficient to full understanding of knowledge transfer. In this paper we argue that knowledge senders' disseminative capacity, i.e, the ability of knowledge holders to efficiently, effectively, and convincingly frame knowledge in a way that other people can Understand accurately and put into practice, plays an equally important role in knowledge transfer process. We examine this argument by employing a single-layer perceptron neural network model (SLPM) in a simulation study with two different network structures to get robust results. We demonstrate that both the disseminative capacity of knowledge senders and the absorptive capacity of knowledge recipients play important roles in knowledge transfer. Also, we found that the prominent knowledge holder plays a paramount role in knowledge transfer under quite different organizational structures. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Against a background of increasing international competition and rapid technological change, universities and industry have often engaged in collaboration as a means of improving cross-unit transfers of the resources, capabilities, and knowledge. Following this frontier, this study examines the effects of university and firm interpartner resource alignment and absorptive capacity on knowledge transfer performance from the university-industry (U-I) perspective. Regression analysis is used to test the hypotheses in a sample of 120 Taiwanese firms. The research findings suggest that, interpartner resource utilization is positively related to U-I interaction; that when the effect of a firm's absorptive capacity is higher, U-I interaction is more favorable; and that U-I interaction is positively related to knowledge transfer performance. Our empirical results support the process-oriented view and indicate that U-I interaction plays the mediating role between resource alignment, absorptive capacity and knowledge transfer performance. The implications of this study are two-fold. First, it emphasizes the value of creative financial and general performance in knowledge transfer by incorporating the U-I interaction perspective. Second, the research results offer support for suggestions that interpartner resource alignment provides a necessary element for capacity and resource exchange. Hence, one interesting further research would analyze practical cases of some Taiwanese companies with the described approach. This is an important practical issue that should be examined in the future.

AB We employed the grounded theory method to construct a framework describing the distinctive mechanisms through which big-science centers generate industrial knowledge spillovers in the economy. Our focus is on large-scale big-science installations typically associated with experimental physics. We draw on social network, social capital, and inter-organizational learning theories to examine knowledge spillovers accruing to industrial partner companies in big-science-industry dyads. The context for the study is provided by CERN's new particle accelerator project, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In addition to building a grounded theory framework for the study of industrial knowledge spillovers, our study demonstrates the distinctive potential that big-science centers offer as a source of knowledge spillovers in national innovation systems.

AB The majority of studies of knowledge spillovers from the presence of multinational corporations (MNCs) have focused on whether or not, rather than how knowledge spillovers occur from MNC subsidiaries to local host country firms. Using survey data from 210 MNC subsidiaries in Sweden, a composite model is developed examining the impact of two different environmental conditions on the occurrence of knowledge spillovers arising from innovation transfer within MNCs. We distinguish between horizontal knowledge spillovers (i.e., to competitors) and vertical knowledge spillovers (i.e., to customers and suppliers), and emphasise the conceptually important distinction between the two. The former are largely unintentional by nature whereas the latter can be considered as intentional knowledge diffusion. The results show that competitive pressure in the recipient subsidiary's local environment gives rise to unintentional knowledge spillovers, whereas it is negatively related to intentional knowledge diffusion. The results also support the notion that the degree of embeddedness of in a subsidiary's business network in the host country is positively related to intentional knowledge diffusion. An important finding of the study is that there is a positive relationship between intentional knowledge diffusion and unintentional knowledge spillovers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper extends the existing literature on strategic R&D alliances by presenting a model of innovation networks with endogenous absorptive capacity. The networks emerge as a result of dynamic cooperation between firms occupying different locations in the knowledge space. Partner selection is driven by absorptive capacity which is itself influenced by cognitive distance and R&D investment allocation. Under different knowledge regimes, we examine the structure of networks that emerge and how firms perform within such networks. We find networks that exhibit small world properties which are generally robust to changes in the knowledge regime. Certain network strategies such as occupying brokerage positions or maximising accessibility to potential partners pay off, especially in 'young' industries with limited involuntary but abundant voluntary spillovers. This particular result is driven by endogenous absorptive capacity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article examines the ways that Australia's largest retail firms accessed and adapted external knowledge flows, largely from the USA, to develop discount department store chains from the late-1960s onwards. In doing so, it extends work on retail internationalisation by focusing on the importation, rather than the exportation of business models. The three firms - Coles, Myer and Woolworths - exhibited differing degrees of absorptive capacity in identifying and commercialising knowledge flows. This was reflected in fluctuating levels of success, the scope of store networks and relative positioning in the Australian market. Further, the role played by informal associations between managers in non-competing firms in different markets during the development of discount department stores in Australia advances the case for socialising analyses of business knowledge transfer more broadly.

AB In the paper, the concept of absorptive capacity, already successfully applied to firms, is extended to territories. Territory's Absorptive Capacity is here defined as the ability of a Region to identify, assimilate, and exploit external knowledge.
   From a theoretical point of view, the concept of Territory's Absorptive Capacity integrates two fields of studies, those of innovation systems and regional science.
   Three propositions are developed starting from the consideration that territory's absorptive capacity is dependent on increasing investments in human resource learning in a Region, promoting R&D activities and, above all, integrating knowledge flows through the action of territorial knowledge gatekeepers.

AB This paper assesses the extent to which absorptive capacity determines knowledge flows' impact on regional innovation. In particular, it looks at how regions with large absorptive capacity make the most of external inflows of knowledge and information brought in by means of inventor mobility and networks, and fosters local innovation. The paper uses an unbalanced panel of 274 regions over 8 years to estimate a regional knowledge production function with fixed-effects. It finds evidence that inflows of inventors are critical for wealthier regions, while it has more nuanced effects for less developed areas. It also shows that regions' absorptive capacity critically adds a premium to tap into remote knowledge pools conveyed by mobility and networks. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Past studies have suggested absorptive capacity plays very important role in knowledge transfer. However, less attention has been paid to the dual process of knowledge transfer, which covers knowledge dissemination and absorption. This study operationalizes the concept of disseminative capacity and analyses differences in disseminative capacity of network members. Theoretical analysis and simulation results showed that the sizes of network, knowledge transfer speed and disseminative capabilities and absorptive capabilities of the individuals in the network have effect on knowledge equilibrium of networks over time. Furthermore, the results showed that the more powerful is a dominant knowledge holder in the network, the quicker the network will converge to a specified knowledge state.

AB Technological advancement is an important instrument for economic and technological development, but most countries receive the benefits of innovation and new technologies through technology transfer. Previous studies typically consider direct linkages in order to understand technological advancement without paying much attention to indirect linkages, such as the inter-connectivity of the recipients of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). To understand the relationship between FDI and technological advancement and whether recipients' absorptive capacity matters, we model global FDI networks for the period 2009-2016. We find empirical evidence that the global FDI network has a core-periphery structure, and that core countries are more technologically developed than peripheral countries. We also find empirical evidence that a country's centrality of position in the global FDI network is positively associated with the technological advancement of a country, and that the absorptive capacity of a country can moderate this relationship. Regression analyses using instrumental variable estimators confirm the robustness of our findings. The most striking finding of our research is the strong moderation effect of knowledge intensity, a constituent of absorptive capacity. This finding provides a nuanced understanding of absorptive capacity, demonstrating the ways a country can benefit from FDI by reshaping the factors related to absorptive capacity.

AB Purpose - This paper aims to focus on knowledge transfer between the headquarters and a subsidiary of a multinational corporation (MNC). A framework with type of knowledge, absorptive capacity, disseminative capacity and tie strength is proposed. The framework is verified qualitatively and then further developed by adding another capacity needed by the headquarters: heeding capacity.
   Design/methodology/approach - To check the validity of the proposed conceptual framework empirically, interview-based qualitative studies were conducted for two partner programs implemented in the Japanese subsidiary of a US-based IT company. Interviews were undertaken with 17 respondents in the headquarters, the Japanese subsidiary and two alliance partners in Japan.
   Findings - It is confirmed that type of knowledge and absorptive capacity clearly affect the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. Also, it is found that the knowledge sender's disseminative capacity matters. Additionally, a case is found in which network ties mitigate the ineffectiveness caused by low disseminative/absorptive capacity.
   Research limitations/implications - In this research, cultural influences have not been considered. Also, this research has not paid attention to inter-organizational knowledge transfer. These provides potential for further research which could explore this complexity in more depth.
   Practical implications - It is suggested that the headquarters of a MNC need to have a "heeding capacity" in cases where the target subsidiary's disseminative capacity is low and tie strength between the subsidiary and the headquarters is weak. It is a capacity for the headquarters to heed what a subsidiary would like to transmit but cannot do well, and this is achieved by listening carefully and not letting language barriers or cultural differences obfuscate the meaning.
   Originality/value - By focusing on a dyad between the headquarters and the Japanese subsidiary, the importance of disseminative capacity of a subsidiary is highlighted, which is not often the case in the extant literature. Also, headquarters' heeding capacity is proposed.

Much of the prior research on absorptive capacity focuses on characterizing the factors that influence absorptive capacity within organizations. However, the mechanism of how related factors affect absorptive capacity across interdependent organizations in project networks remains less explored. This paper extends a simulation model of project network learning to explore the absorptive capacity of project networks where periodic external innovations exist. This model is utilized in a series of simulation experiments to untangle the effects of varying types of innovation and degrees of relational instability in a project network. We establish a measure of project network absorptive capacity and develop an argument that relational instability moderates the project network's absorptive capacity for different types of innovation. These findings have significant implications for assessing and developing strategies to improve a project organizational network's capacity to absorb and, hence, profit from innovation.

AB The extant literature has highlighted the importance of knowledge transfer between a buyer and its supply network for strengthening supply chain competence. This is a bi-directional exchange where the buyer and supply network each act as the sender and receiver of knowledge. Prior research has however largely focused on the knowledge recipient only. We consider both sender and recipient using two key dynamic capabilities related to knowledge transfer: (i) desorptive capacity, which enables the safe transfer of knowledge from the sender; and, (ii) absorptive capacity, which enables the acquisition and assimilation of external knowledge by the recipient. Using the concept of 'fit', we investigate whether organisations strengthen supply chain competence when their desorptive capacity exceeds that of their supply network's (positive misfit) and consider the moderating role of the organisation's and supply network's absorptive capacity. Multiple regression analysis of survey data from 250 firms identifies an inverted U-shaped relationship between positive desorptive capacity misfit and supply chain competence. Further, this relationship is shown to be moderated by the supply network's absorptive capacity level. The paper furthers our understanding of supply chain knowledge management enabling buyers and their supply networks to achieve more successful knowledge transfer outcomes.

AB Usually, knowledge spillovers (KS) are related to geographic proximity. In the present study, we measure KS on the basis of different proximity matrices, focusing on the relational, social, cognitive and technological preconditions for knowledge diffusion. In the light of previous studies on KS, we examine: (i) which types of proximity enhance or hamper knowledge flows, and (ii) whether local absorptive capacity favour such flows. Our results indicate that KS across European NUTS2 regions measured through geographic, relational, social, cognitive and technological proximity channels increase with local absorptive capacity. This finding points towards the emergence of large clusters of regions (absorptive capacity clubs) where relational, cognitive, social and technological proximity lock-in maximizes the returns to local investment in R&D.

AB Purpose
   This study aims to address the relevance of the mediating role of the relative absorptive capacity (ACAP-R) in the relation between absorptive capacity and innovation, contributing to a better understanding of innovation in a business network. Participants' firms in this study are part of the supply network of an automotive cluster.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The study is developed in 225 companies that are part of the supply network of an automotive cluster in Mexico. A survey was applied to key firm informants who had been involved on processes of innovation, quality or continuous improvement. During data analysis, structural equation modeling was implemented with the support of SmartPLS 3.0 to understand the mediation role of relative absorptive capacity as a novel insight of innovation in a Mexican cluster.
   Findings
   The results demonstrate the partial mediator role of the ACAP-R among the absorptive capacities and the level of innovation of the companies that make up the network studied. The findings represent an approach to the understanding of one of the key dynamic capacities in the innovation process and, thus, to the competitiveness of organizations, which has scarcely been studied from the perspective of business networks.
   Originality/value
   The findings provide useful insights not only in terms of understanding the link between absorptive capacity and innovation, but also how to improve levels of innovation through knowledge exchanges that occur during the participation of suppliers and customers in a business network. Firms with high levels of ACAP are more likely to recognize the opportunity to benefit from external knowledge and to participate intensely in collaborative efforts. That is, technological similarity or similar knowledge base between source or recipient firms impacts their innovation.

AB From a knowledge-processing perspective, this study presents an integrative conceptual framework to analyse the roles of innovation intermediaries within knowledge systems of industrial clusters. The empirical basis of the conceptual framework is demonstrated with an in-depth case study of Zhejiang Institute of Modern Textile Industry, an innovation intermediary that greatly facilitates knowledge spillover, application and integration in the Shaoxing Textile industrial cluster in China. This case analysis shows that an innovation intermediary can play the roles of technology gatekeeper, technology spanner, technical problem solver, and innovation resource integrator within the knowledge system of an industrial cluster. In addition, examining the process of intermediation reveals that absorptive capacity, knowledge complexity, presence of a structural hole and network centrality are critical to the role in which innovation intermediaries function within the knowledge systems of industrial clusters.

AB Managerial ties-the boundary-spanning ties and interpersonal connections of top managers-contribute to a corporation's innovativeness in emerging economies because of the absence of market supporting institutions, transparent laws, and clear regulations. Moreover, managerial ties are apt to interact with absorptive capacity to facilitate knowledge sharing and innovation. This paper examines the joint influence of managerial ties and absorptive capacity in two communities in China, one characterized by a high level of foreign direct investment (FDI) and the other consisting mainly of local corporations. We find that absorptive capacity moderates the effect of managerial ties on a corporation's innovativeness. Furthermore, when examining the two communities separately, we find that business ties and university ties have opposite effects.

Regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses in a sample of 137 alliance cases. The findings suggest that knowledge transfer performance is positively affected by the explicitness of knowledge and firm's absorptive capacity; that equity-based alliance will transfer tacit knowledge more effectively while contract-base alliance is more effective for the transfer of explicit knowledge; and that trust and adjustment have positive effects while conflict possesses a curvilinear effect on knowledge transfer performance.

AB Absorptive capacity may be defined as a dynamic capability that allows firms to recognise the value of new external knowledge, assimilate and apply it with commercial purposes. It is a multidimensional construct whose dimensions are generally considered as knowledge acquisition, assimilation, transformation and application. Nevertheless, there are a number of ambiguities about the own concept, which make it difficult the depiction of the knowledge absorption process and its dimensions. Therefore, this paper revises the main contributions on this topic and construct, along with its antecedents and consequences. Based on this review, we develop a number of theoretical ideas and we propose a new configuration for knowledge absorptive process. This new model stresses the importance of knowledge identification and understanding process as previous stage for knowledge acquisition and its role in the entire absorptive process.

AB In this paper, we examine the role of firms' absorptive capacity in industry-university collaboration and, in particular, whether absorptive capacity moderates the effects of university collaboration on firms' innovativeness. Having defined absorptive capacity as the recognition, assimilation and application of valuable external knowledge for commercial purposes, we formulated three hypotheses pertaining to firm innovativeness and tested them in an original survey comprising a representative multi-industry sample of 1,532 Swedish firms. The results suggest that benefiting from university cooperation is conditional upon the firm's level of absorptive capacity. At low levels of absorptive capacity, engaging with universities does not translate into any noticeable increase in innovative output. In contrast, medium to high levels of absorptive capacity is where a firm benefit most from collaborating with a university. We also show that these effects are more pronounced for firms operating in sectors characterised by lower levels of technology and knowledge intensity.

AB Knowledge acquired through external network relationships is widely accepted as one of the most important resources for a firm to be innovative. This is especially true for the networked tourism industry, where capabilities associated with the acquisition, assimilation and exploitation of external knowledge ('absorptive capacity') are paramount. While several studies highlight the importance of network relationships to acquire new knowledge, most of them remain vague in explaining their impact on the assimilation and exploitation of the knowledge. This paper investigates the impacts of network relationships on absorptive capacity dimensions. A quantitative survey among 378 hotel businesses was carried out to measure network participation and relationship quality as well as the absorptive capacity. Regression models reveal that the quality of external relationships and the overall network size implicate access and availability of valuable knowledge and positively affect the organization's capacity to assimilate and exploit the knowledge in pursuit of innovation.

AB The concept of absorptive capacity has already been considerably studied from a theoretical perspective, but few, if any, attempts at operationalizing the concept have been studied in ways that would allow its full assessment. The more specific focus provided by the four dimensions identified in some recent literature - acquisition, assimilation, transformation and exploitation - opens up some promising avenues for operationalizing the concept. This exploratory research studies and describes case studies of ten innovative companies using a cross-sectional research design. In the first part of the article, we re-examine the concept of absorptive capacity in terms of dynamic capabilities and provide a review of the relevant literature. The second part describes the work accomplished to operationalize the concept of dynamic capability and analyses the possible relationship between the business strategies adopted by the companies studied and their particular strategic capacity.

AB Through the lens of social capital perspective, this paper assesses how individuals' interactions and their learning capabilities explain the transfer of good practices in an interorganizational network. Primary data were collected from export consortia in Tunisia through a questionnaire survey. The research underlines the impact of the strength and the range of ties between managers. It is also found that managers' absorptive capacity moderates the impact of the strength of ties. This study considers the individual's behavior at the heart of the knowledge transfer process and suggests a substitution effect between the strength of social ties and individual's absorptive capacity.

AB Absorptive capacity is a common barrier to knowledge transfer at the individual level. However, technology absorptive capacity can enhance an individual's learning behaviour. This study investigates that technology readiness, the tools for knowledge sources, social influences, and social networks influence an individual's absorptive capacity on an adaptation of the individual learning behaviour. A quantitative approach is used to assess the presence of a causal relationship from the constructs mentioned above. Data were collected from university students in Australia to examine the hypotheses. With 199 responses, a partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) approach was used for the analysis. The results generated mixed findings. Individual's technological belief in optimism and innovation and social influences had a significantly weaker effect on individual absorptive capacity, which in turn had a significantly weaker impact on their learning behaviour.

AB Despite increasing research on reverse knowledge transfer (RKT) from subsidiaries to headquarters (HQs), there is no academic consensus on the primary determinants influencing RKT. By incorporating four different facets (i.e., absorption, sharing, implanting, and application of market knowledge) of the phenomenon, we draw new insights into RKT. Through empirically testing the phenomenon in the Korean context, we reveal that market knowledge absorption by subsidiaries is a critical component that influences the knowledge integration mechanisms (KIMs) within MNC networks. Furthermore, KIMs within MNC networks are primary keys for absorptive capacity (AC) of HQs and knowledge relevance between HQs and subsidiaries. Our results extend our understanding of RKT, while also offering useful implications for MNCs that intend to establish subsidiaries in foreign markets. Copyright (c) 2016 ASAC.

AB This study examines the extent to which the intra-industry knowledge spillover and a firm's alliance portfolio diversity have an effect on product innovation performance and the growth of different size of firms. A model was proposed and empirically tested using structural equation modelling with Bayesian estimation. The data was extracted from the Colombian innovation survey EDIT from 2011 to 2016 and comprised a sample of 913 manufacturing firms. The results demonstrated that less-developed and resource-scarce settings, such as Colombia, foster interfirm collaboration regardless of their size. Nevertheless, even when considered the positive and significant effect of collaboration, spillovers are the most relevant external knowledge source in explaining the product innovation performance and growth of small and medium firms. The findings also showed that knowledge spillovers can be detrimental to the large firms' outcomes, possibly associated with a weaker appropriability regime and the loss of knowledge derived from outgoing spillovers.

AB A firm's absorptive capacity involves two dimensions: horizontal and vertical. The horizontal dimension refers to a dynamic interplay between internal and external environments of the firm, which is extensively covered in the absorptive capacity research. However, the literature ignores vertical dimension involving individual-organization interactions. Scant knowledge is available about the mechanisms through which absorptive capacity emerges as an organizational learning capability. This study reviews the seminal works of Cohen and Levinthal and finds that the stickiness of knowledge, the multiple antecedents of absorptive capacity and their interattions are explicitly addressed therein, but are insufficiently problematized in subsequent research. Drawing on the knowledge-based view of the firm and the micro-foundations lens of organizational capabilities, the present study re-conceptualizes absorptive capacity as a set of three sequentially linked learning processes where individual and organizational antecedents interact, and explains how value recognition, assimilation and application capabilities emerge as organizational (macro) level phenomena.

AB How to realize the sustainable development of the industry-university-research institute (IUR) collaboration innovation ecosystem has become a key factor restricting the independent innovation capability of Chinese enterprises. Knowledge transfer performance is a key consideration in the process of R&D collaboration between companies and research institutes; how to improve the performance of knowledge transfer depends on the matching between the partners of IUR collaboration. This article seeks to explore the influence mechanism of partner differences in the industry-university-research institute collaboration on the performance of knowledge transfer from the perspective of enterprises. Specifically, the study explores the moderating effect of technical knowledge difference and goal difference on the relationship between absorptive capacity, learning willingness, and knowledge transfer performance. The study applied the partial least squares structural equation modeling approach to model these relationships, based on survey data gathered from 211 Chinese firms. The results show that the goal difference of industry-university-research institute collaboration partners has a negative moderating effect on the relationship between learning willingness, absorptive capacity, and knowledge transfer performance. The greater the degree of goal difference, the lower the role of the enterprise's learning willingness and absorptive capacity to promote knowledge transfer performance. Technical knowledge difference has a significant inverted U-shaped effect on the relationship between absorptive capacity and knowledge transfer performance: a high degree of technical knowledge difference weakens the effects of absorptive capacity on knowledge transfer performance, while a low degree of technical knowledge difference will also negatively moderate the effects of absorptive capacity on knowledge transfer performance. The research conclusions provide scientists, government bodies, and decision makers with the necessary information for a better understanding of the effective mechanism of sustainable knowledge transfer in the IUR innovation ecosystem.

AB The purpose of this perspective paper is to advance understanding of absorptive capacity, its underlying dimensions, its multilevel antecedents, its impact on firm performance, and the contextual factors that affect absorptive capacity. Twenty years after the Cohen and Levinthal 1990 paper, the field is characterized by a wide array of theoretical perspectives and a wealth of empirical evidence. In this paper, we first review these underlying theories and empirical studies of absorptive capacity. Given the size and diversity of the absorptive capacity literature, we subsequently map the existing terrain of research through a bibliometric analysis. The resulting bibliometric cartography shows the major discrepancies in the organization field, namely that (1) most attention so far has been focused on the tangible outcomes of absorptive capacity; (2) organizational design and individual level antecedents have been relatively neglected in the absorptive capacity literature; and (3) the emergence of absorptive capacity from the actions and interactions of individual, organizational, and interorganizational antecedents remains unclear. Building on the bibliometric analysis, we develop an integrative model that identifies the multilevel antecedents, process dimensions, and outcomes of absorptive capacity as well as the contextual factors that affect absorptive capacity. We argue that realizing the potential of the absorptive capacity concept requires more research that shows how "micro-antecedents" and " macro-antecedents" influence future outcomes such as competitive advantage, innovation, and firm performance. In particular, we identify conceptual gaps that may guide future research to fully exploit the absorptive capacity concept in the organization field and to explore future fruitful extensions of the concept.

AB Objective: The main objective of the article is to examine the effect of organisational learning orientation (OLO) and absorptive capacity (AC) on innovation capability (IC).
   Research Design & Methods: The hypotheses were tested on a sample of 239 respondents. Hypotheses were verified by means of structural equation modelling (SEM), using the asymptotically distribution-free method (ADF).
   Findings: A change in organisational learning orientation brings about changes in absorptive capacity, which in turn influences business innovation capability. Absorptive capacity is affected mostly by two dimensions of organisational learning orientation: commitment to learning (OLO1) and open-mindedness (OLO3). In turn, absorptive capacity affected by organisational learning orientation has the strongest impact on product innovation (IC1), a lesser impact on process innovation (ICA2), and the weakest impact on managerial innovation (IC3). Moreover, the process of knowledge sharing (KS) mediates the effect of absorptive capacity on each of the dimensions of innovation capability.
   Implications & Recommendations: First, this study expands our understanding of the effect of learning orientation on absorptive capacity. Second, it confirms the presence of a statistically significant and positive relationship between absorptive capacity and innovation capability. The third implication concerns the indirect dependencies between absorptive capacity and innovation capability.
   Contribution & Value Added: The study identifies and examines mechanisms that support the transformation of external knowledge - already acquired and used by an organisation - into innovations.

AB University Spin-Offs (USOs) are actively involved in the knowledge spillover process and fully integrated in the regional innovation systems. Drawing on the Knowledge Spillover Theory of Entrepreneurship and using a multilevel approach of analysis, we explore whether the region's knowledge spillover and the firm's absorptive capacity jointly determine the innovative performance of USOs. At regional level, technological spillovers, production spillovers, and human capital spillovers have been considered. The results from a cross-national panel sample of 401 and 711 Spanish and Italian USOs, over the period 2005-13 and located in twenty-two administrative regions, show that only the production spillovers have a significant positive effect on the USO's innovative activity. Firm-specific characteristics are important for explaining USOs' innovation. More specifically, firm age has a negative effect, while firm size seems to have a positive effect. Additionally, USOs active in high-tech sectors seem to perform better in their innovation activity.

AB This study investigates the role of intellectual capital (i.e., human, social, and organization capital)-enhancing human resource (HR) practices in the development of a firm's absorptive capacity, as well as the mediating role of absorptive capacity in its relationship to the firm's innovation performance. Results show that while human capital-enhancing HR (acquisition and developmental HR) is positively related to absorptive capacity, social capital-enhancing HR affects absorptive capacity through egalitarian HR practices. Organization capital-enhancing HR practices contribute to absorptive capacity through effective information systems. Finally, our findings confirm that the various intellectual capital-enhancing HR practices affect innovation performance through their impact on the firm's absorptive capacity.

AB This paper provides the profiling on the 'relative absorptive capacity of knowledge' research to provide insights of the field based on data collected from the ISI Web of science database during the years 2001-2010. The analysis is established in three phases, namely, the general publication, the subject area, and the topic profiling. The study obtains patterns, characteristics, and attributes at country, institutions, journals, author, and core reference levels. It shows the increase of the research activity in the field, based on the publication productivity during the years mentioned. Most of these publications are classified in the subject areas of business and economics, engineering, and operations research and management science. We highlight the nascent interest of the computer science subject area as a way to operationalize the different studies conducted. We found a lack of contribution from African and Latin-American countries despite the importance of the field for them. Our results are useful in terms of science strategy, science and technology policy, research agendas, research alliances, and research networks according to the special interest of specific actors at the individual, institutional, and national levels.

AB The development of clusters rests on geographical proximity, cognitive interactions as well as entrepreneurial initiatives. Sophia Antipolis, a multi-technology cluster in Valbonne, France, is a good illustration of the type of challenges local systems of innovation face in creating positive knowledge externalities. This paper shows that if the existence of 'gatekeepers of knowledge' can generate the potential implementation of 'absorptive capacity', its effective realization requires some additional effort regarding the transfer of knowledge into the cluster. The concept of 'platform of knowledge' defined shows how a project of knowledge codification could generate externalities by creating new opportunities for effectively combining and absorbing knowledge.

AB The main objective of this study is to answer the question of how farmers' networking behaviour and their ability to acquire, assimilate, transform and exploit external knowledge is related to their level of innovativeness and profitability. These relations were tested on the basis of structural equation modeling using 444 questionnaires completed by large-scale pig farmers in the Netherlands. Previous studies on the relation between network structure and innovativeness retained the absorptive capacity 'black box' by using proxies for absorption of knowledge. The present study addresses this shortcoming by studying absorptive capacity in terms of organizational capacities (routines and processes) of farmers to use their networks and absorb external knowledge. The findings show that frequency of contact in a specific network range affects innovativeness positively, but also indirectly through acquisition and assimilation capacity. Assimilation capacity turns out to be the most important dimension of absorptive capacity for the innovativeness of pig farmers.

AB This paper analyzes the impact of knowledge spillovers on firm performance measured through total sales, the percentage of innovative sales and a categorical variable that classifies firms into three different groups depending on the stage of their sales growth evolution: upturn, downturn, or transition. We specifically focus on whether there are asymmetric spillover effects depending on the intermediary role of firms' technological relatedness, which we proxy by the use of external sources of knowledge. Using data on 5900 Spanish firms for the period 2004-2016, we find that spillover effects from intra-sector and upstream knowledge pools are-in general-positive, although with some differences depending on the measure of firm performance and on the moderating role of technological networking. Our results also suggest the presence of a "business stealing effect" in environments with a high proportion of knowledge-based gross added value. Furthermore, we find that spillover effects are asymmetric depending on the firm's size and intensity of R&D employment. Knowledge spillovers seem to play a more significant role in the case of SMEs than in large companies, and firms with high intensities of R&D employment benefit more from upstream spillovers and less from horizontal spillovers than firms with low intensities.

AB The study investigates how a multinational corporation (MNC) can promote the absorptive capacity of its subsidiaries. The focus is on what drives the MNC subsidiary's ability to absorb marketing strategies that are initiated by the MNC parent, as well as how the subsidiary enacts on this absorptive capacity in order to compete in its focal market. The dual embeddedness of MNC subsidiaries plays a key role in this investigation, as subsidiaries belong to the MNC network and are simultaneously embedded in their host country environment. We argue that subsidiary absorptive capacity is formed as a purposeful response to this dual embeddedness. An analysis of marketing strategy absorptions undertaken by 213 subsidiaries reveals that MNCs can assist their subsidiaries to compete in competitive and dynamic focal markets by forming specific organizational mechanisms that are conducive to the development of subsidiary absorptive capacity. The findings hold important theoretical and practical implications.

AB This paper has as its aim to analyse multinational enterprises' location decisions from the perspective of the knowledge-based firm in an attempt to answer the following questions: Are innovative MNEs more likely to be located in areas with a higher degree of agglomeration? Who benefits to a greater extent - in terms of innovation - from geographical proximity with other agents: national or foreign enterprises? What role does absorptive capacity play in the relationship between agglomeration and innovation? According to this research work, agglomeration differently influences the innovation of MNE subsidiaries - through knowledge spillovers - depending on the types of agglomerated companies. The analysis performed with a sample of firms located in Spain includes local and foreign companies and uses data from a survey conducted by the National Statistics Institute (INE for its Spanish initials) in 2016. The results show that the agglomeration of similar enterprises favours innovation amongst foreign firms, as opposed to local ones, which absorb both positive and negative effects.

AB This research investigates the impact of the internal social network on new venture's innovation by building a comprehensive structural equation modeling (SEM) that integrates three streams of research: internal social network, innovation, and absorptive capacity. Based on a sample of 279 new ventures from China, the current study's results show that absorptive capacity plays a full mediating effect in the relationship of the internal social network and innovation. Particularly, among the skill set of absorptive capacity, a mere skill of knowledge acquisition does not guarantee an enhancement of new venture's innovation. For new ventures to better utilize the social capital generated by the internal network in the process of innovation, they must focus more on the skills of knowledge digestion and knowledge application. The authors further separate the new ventures into two different sub-samples: the new venture supported by mature enterprises (M-type) and the independent new venture (I-type). This study's findings indicate that the effect of the social network on innovation through knowledge digestion is greater in the M-type sample than in the I-type sample; internal social network heterogeneity in general plays a less important role in improving a new venture's innovation than internal social network density, for both M-type and I-type new ventures.

AB Increased understanding of knowledge transfer (KT) from universities to the wider regional knowledge ecosystem offers opportunities for increased regional innovation and commercialisation. The aim of this article is to improve the understanding of the KT phenomena in an open innovation context where multiple diverse quadruple helix stakeholders are interacting. An absorptive capacity-based conceptual framework is proposed, using a priori constructs which portrays the multidimensional process of KT between universities and its constituent stakeholders in pursuit of open innovation and commercialisation. Given the lack of overarching theory in the field, an exploratory, inductive theory building methodology was adopted using semi-structured interviews, document analysis and longitudinal observation data over a three-year period. The findings identify five factors, namely human centric factors, organisational factors, knowledge characteristics, power relationships and network characteristics, which mediate both the ability of stakeholders to engage in KT and the effectiveness of knowledge acquisition, assimilation, transformation and exploitation. This research has implications for policy makers and practitioners by identifying the need to implement interventions to overcome the barriers to KT effectiveness between regional quadruple helix stakeholders within an open innovation ecosystem.

AB This research evaluates the role of science and technology parks as locations fostering local knowledge exchange and promoting innovation. We consider that these knowledge externalities depend on firms' internal efforts and strategies, since their capacity to understand and exploit others' knowledge depends on their own knowledge base. Empirical evidence has been gathered from 2007 to 2011 in a longitudinal analysis on 11,201 firms in total, using a Spanish database from PITEC (Technological Innovation Panel). Results of a two Tobit models with random effects, confirm our hypotheses. First, firms with previous cooperation agreements with universities and research institutions would benefit most from the park as they can more easily incorporate existing knowledge in the park and improve their product innovation. Secondly, results also seem to indicate that product innovation is higher when firms with internal R&D efforts can share knowledge on a reciprocal basis with other firms that are also investing in R&D.

The main purpose of this work is to show the relationship existing between the firm's absorptive capacity (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990) and knowledge transfer. To be able to measure the absorptive capacity, we focused on the role played by human resources in science, technology and innovation (HRISTI). For knowledge transfer analysis we have considered the cooperation projects for innovation performed by the companies as proxy indicators of knowledge interaction. The results obtained show that the patterns of knowledge interaction in the Basque firms are associated to their HRICTI profile.

AB The combination of knowledge and innovation has become a cornerstone among knowledge and labour intensive enterprises. A growing number of enterprises are defined as knowledge intensive entrepreneurship ventures that have been widely studied in relation to their eco-system. However only few research have addressed this phenomenon to enterprises digital eco-system by adopting mainly a qualitatively approach. We point out that the relevance of the digital eco-system focusing on the role of social networking sites in relationship to innovation and knowledge. The use of social networking sites can provide a wealth of information about individuals and their networks, which can be utilised for various business purposes. It enables enterprises to create online communities and share user-created content. Within this context, enterprises actively interact with external actors such as customers, public institutions, and other businesses to acquire and absorb external knowledge, and then generate innovation. To gain insights from the global economy, 215 small to medium enterprises from different sets of global enterprises, both knowledge-intensive (e.g. management consulting, marketing and advertising, ICT and related services, legal and technical services) and labour-intensive (such as high tech and electronics, food and beverage, and consumer durables), were analysed. Via the Partial Least Square-Path Modelling the relationships between social networking sites, absorptive capacity, and innovation performance were measured. Therefore, recommendations are proffered as to what small-medium enterprises should do in order to enhance their innovativeness. The research ends with conclusions and implications to both scholars and practitioners.

AB We explore the roles that potential and realized absorptive capacity play in enhancing firm performance, and examine external knowledge search strategies as antecedents of absorptive capacity. In this way, we endeavor to open the black box that sits between external knowledge search and performance, and suggest that the establishment of deep and broad relationships with external sources has differing impacts on potential and realized absorptive capacity for the firm. We argue that distinguishing clearly between potential and realized absorptive capacity may provide new insights into understanding why some companies are more successful than others at benefiting from external knowledge. A sample of 171 suppliers operating in the Iranian automotive industry is used to test the proposed theoretical model, through a two-stage least squares approach. Surprisingly, our results indicate that only the firm's capability to acquire and assimilate new ideas from the external environment (potential absorptive capacity) is related to performance for these firms operating in Iran, which been isolated from global markets due to international sanctions. Our findings emphasize the notion that potential and realized absorptive capacity represent distinct capabilities, with different antecedents and different impacts on firm performance.

AB Purpose - In innovation networks, firm innovation performance is affected by external tie strength and internal knowledge absorptive capacity. This study aims to empirically examine the path relationship between tie strength, absorptive capacity and firm innovation performance in Chinese manufacturing industries, thus enhance our understanding on the mechanism between innovation network and innovation performance.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors have conducted a survey among Chinese manufacturers in four industries (textile and garment, household appliance, IT and electronics and motor vehicle assemblers) that are located in North, East, Central and South China, respectively, with a valid response from 278 manufacturers. Structural equation model is used to analyze the results.
   Findings - This study demonstrates that in Chinese Manufacturing industry, tie strength is positively related to innovation performance. The authors also find that absorptive capacity has a positive impact on innovation performance and it mediates the relationship between tie strength and innovation performance. Then, the authors analyze the effect of ownership, industry and sub-region, and the results show that in private firms and traditional manufacturers, and the firms located in North and Eastern China, tie strength has no direct effect on innovation outcomes, but it can influence innovation indirectly through absorptive capacity.
   Originality/value - This study further supports that in Chinese guanxi culture, strong ties with other innovation partners can improve the firm's absorptive capacity and thus improve innovation performance. The results also suggest that a firm's absorptive capacity has a significant mediating effect on the relationship between tie strength and innovation performance.

AB Objective: This article aims to study the process of innovation in national microenterprises of services in crisis environments.
   Literary Reference: Absorptive capacity is a mechanism that enables companies from different industry sectors, such as services, to develop innovative services through the recognition of the value of identified opportunities and assimilation of external knowledge by the company. It was observed the lack of literature on innovation in service microenterprises, both national and foreign enterprises.
   Methodological procedures: The research method adopted is exploratory qualitative research through multiple case studies, which allowed to deepen the understanding of the innovation process in microenterprises. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with four microenterprises chosen based on the dimensions prior knowledge (antecedents) and external knowledge according to the maximum variation criterion.
   Result: The result suggests that the domestic laundry microenterprises can develop absorptive capacity concentrating their efforts in the interorganizational relationships focused on suppliers and clients and in the intraorganizational ones centered on previous knowledge and sharing knowledge.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this study is to increase understanding of service innovation in networks. Especially the most loosely coupled forms of innovation networks, innovation communities, can be valuable in service innovation, but may not be manageable in the traditional sense. Rather, they may require orchestration characterized by discreet guidance that also accommodates the specific nature of services. Through informed orchestration, it is possible to deal with several contingencies, and influence the absorptive capacity at the network level to generate new service innovations.
   Design/methodology/approach - These issues are examined through literature review and a case study.
   Findings - The findings suggest that individual orchestration mechanisms may be more closely connected to certain contingencies than others, and that both orchestration mechanisms and contingency factors have a role in absorptive capacity development within service innovation networks.
   Research limitations/implications - While the case study approach limits the possibility to make wide generalizations, the in-depth insights provide valuable knowledge.
   Practical implications - There has been a shift from inter-firm competition towards competition between networks of organizations, increasing relevance of absorptive capacity at the network level.
   Originality/value - Despite the recent increase in service innovation literature, research on service innovation taking place in networks is scant. Knowledge on some aspects can be derived from more traditional notions on technological innovation, but both the distinctive features of services and central characteristics of innovation networks make it necessary to reconsider some of the established views. In particular, managing - or rather orchestrating - service innovation is still a challenging area.

AB We present a dynamic model of firm absorptive capacity, which is consistent with a process-oriented conceptualization and based on the teaching-learning approach, to investigate the effect of social interactions among the firm members on the firm absorptive capacity. In particular, two main learning processes are considered: the explorative and the transformative learning. To develop the model, the Ising approach, which is a very well established framework to study the dynamics of social interactions, is employed. Furthermore, a simulation analysis is carried out to investigate the effect of two patterns and four levels of social interactions on the firm absorptive capacity. Results show that block-diagonal patterns, where interactions occur inside groups and not between groups (such as in modular organizations), lead to higher absorptive capacity, compared to hierarchical patterns (e.g., those exhibited by centralized organizations). We also show that the relationship between the level of social interactions and the firm absorptive capacity follows an inverted-U shape in the block-diagonal patterns, while the absorptive capacity decreases as the level of interactions rises, in the hierarchical patterns. Finally, we find that the social network also plays a moderating role on the relationship between the complementary knowledge and the firm absorptive capacity.

AB This study examines how subsidiaries can manage dual embeddedness with both local partners and a multinational enterprise. Specifically, we examine the role of absorptive capacity and appropriability mechanisms on subsidiary performance. We analyse how absorptive capacity and appropriability enable subsidiaries to successfully address knowledge challenges related to internal and external networks. We conducted an empirical analysis on a sample of 165 subsidiaries. Our results suggest that absorptive capacity has a direct, positive effect on subsidiary performance, which is greater in emerging countries. The study also found an indirect effect of absorptive capacity on subsidiary performance, which is mediated through appropriability mechanisms. These findings extend the literature on international networks, dual embeddedness and absorptive capacity.

AB This article explores the potential of university technology business incubators to enhance the absorptive capacity of new technology-based firms. The research pursues three critical themes: it employs the absorptive capacity construct to analyse and evaluate the potential of incubation to strengthen the business model of new technology firms. It then explores the interaction between founders and incubator directors, mentors and business advisers to assess how this might enhance absorptive capacity. Finally, it indicates how such interactions can facilitate the transition from potential to realised absorptive capacity. The article interrogates the incubation process by using the absorptive capacity framework to evaluate how it might strengthen the business model of new technology firms. The qualitative findings suggest that where founders, advisers, mentors and incubator directors engage collaboratively to create an iterative dialogue which informs the development of a viable business model, the process by which potential absorptive capacity can be fully realised is substantially strengthened.

AB Through analyzing in-depth interview data obtained from representatives of U.K.-based social enterprises, we explore how traditional third-sector organizations acquire entrepreneurial knowledge via knowledge spillover and use this to transform themselves into more market-driven, businesslike social enterprises. An integrated framework for knowledge spillover is developed to highlight the connection with organizational efforts at each stage of the knowledge spillover process; this framework assists organizations in collecting leaked knowledge and turning it into both organizational action and specific social and human capital that can play an important role in facilitating these connections. This research contributes toward our further understanding of the knowledge spillover phenomenon. Copyright (c) 2015 Strategic Management Society.

AB Patents on an international level are essential for firm results. Accordingly, the use of external sources of knowledge acquires crucial importance to get global innovations and create competitive advantages. For that reason, the literature has highlighted the strategic rote of the absorptive capacity construct.
   We enrich the treatment of the absorptive capacity phases including the moderating effects between routines associated to the traditional potential-realized absorptive capacities. Taking into account external knowledge search strategies, the deeper external relationships, the better transference and appropriation of specific external knowledge. Nevertheless, when the moderating role of assimilation is included, cooperation agreements appear as the most efficient source of external knowledge. Finally, we show that technological tools let firms store and structure the information making easier its use for international patenting. This positive effect is reinforced in the presence of exploitation routines, since technological knowledge will better fit to the industry's key factors of success. (C) 2017 ACEDE.

AB This article seeks to address two fundamental questions: (1) Does social capital (SC) embedded in global buyer-supplier (GBS) relationships enhance local firms' potential absorptive capacity (PAC) and realized absorptive capacity (RAC)? And (2) What are the effects of local firms' PAC and RAC on their innovation outcomes? Based on survey data collected from 297 Chinese firms engaged in GBS cooperation in China's Yangtze River Delta region, we test our research hypotheses with the structural equation modelling approach. The empirical findings indicate that both structural and relational SC are important antecedents of PAC and RAC in global buyer-supplier relationships. More specifically, RAC not only improves local suppliers' new product performance, but also fully mediates the relationship between PAC and new product performance. Our results have two major implications for practicing managers. First, local suppliers in emerging economies need to pay more attention to SC embedded in GBS relationships for it is an important means for them to overcome resource constraints and therefore to improve their new product performance. Second, it is important for managers in local firms to continuously improve their PAC to better assess and assimilate external knowledge, and extend their RAC to upgrade their interpretation and comprehension of commercialization possibilities, which allows for generating synergy of knowledge recombination with existing core competencies.

AB A case study of copper interconnect technology suggests that absorptive capacity exist in three forms: disciplinary, domain specific and encoded. Each involves different ways of managing R&D and linking internal to external research. Disciplinary absorptive capacity requires a firm to actively engage with the scientific community, while protecting domain-specific knowledge. Domain-specific absorptive capacity depends upon influencing disciplinary research at universities and consortia, then capturing domain knowledge through collaboration and hiring. As technology develops, it becomes encoded, and absorption depends increasingly upon integrating knowledge from suppliers. Hence, absorptive capacity is a multifaceted construct that is heavily shaped by the type and maturity of technology absorbed.

AB The combination of external new knowledge and organizational capability has become a cornerstone in the internationalized enterprises. Sources of knowledge acquisition are among the most valuable resources that an internationalized firm can achieve competitive advantage. This study aims to explore this phenomenon between knowledge sources and competitive advantage in the context of internationalized small and medium enterprises (SMEs) mainly by a quantitative approach. Based on contextual nature of resource-capability-competitive, absorptive capacity has long been a critical construct in organizational studies, as well as referring relational embeddedness as potential drivers of absorptive capacity, which is moderated by learning orientation. This study also investigates the mediating effect of absorptive capacity in terms of knowledge absorption and integration on international competitive advantage. To gain insights and provide essential implications for internationalized SMEs from the global economy, this study adopted purposive sampling to collect 211 valid responses. Via the partial least-squares structural modeling, the relationships among relational embeddedness, potential and realized absorptive capacity, and competitive advantage were measured. The results suggest that relational embeddedness positively influences potential and realized absorptive capacity with moderating effect of learning orientation. Potential and realized absorptive capacities have full mediating effect between relational embeddedness and competitive advantage. This study concludes insights and implications for research and practice.

AB Despite the potential of health information technology (HIT) systems to significantly reduce medical errors, streamline clinical processes, contain healthcare costs, and ultimately improve the quality of healthcare, their adoption by hospitals in the United States has been rather slow. To study this adoption process and get insights into the underlying mechanisms, in this work we synthesize the theories on social networks and knowledge transfer. We propose a research framework in which the absorptive capacity of a potential adopter and the collective disseminative capacity of connected adopters act as two key determinants of knowledge transfer in a socioeconomic network, and these two capacities substitute for each other in affecting HIT adoption. We also propose that, in a network setting, the mechanism of knowledge transfer manifests quite differently from that of social contagion in its impact on the diffusion process at different stages of adoption. Using a large longitudinal data set covering adoption decisions of more than five thousand hospitals across a thirteen-year horizon, we find strong support for our hypotheses. Our analysis shows that knowledge flow in provider networks plays a key role in fostering technology diffusion in initial years, allowing the contagion effect to set in sooner for quicker adoption in later years. Therefore, recent efforts at multiple levels to form integrated healthcare delivery networks should accelerate HIT adoption.

AB Absorptive capacity is frequently highlighted as a key determinant of knowledge transfer within multinational enterprises. But how individual behaviour translates into absorptive capacity at the subsidiary level, and how this is contingent on subsidiaries' social context, remains under-addressed. This not only limits our understanding of the relationship between individual- and organizational-level absorptive capacity, but also hampers further research on potentially relevant managerial and organizational antecedents, and limits the implications we can draw for practitioners who seek to increase their organization's capacity to put new knowledge to use. To address this shortcoming we conduct an in-depth comparative case study of a headquarters-initiated knowledge transfer at two subsidiaries of the same multinational enterprise. The findings demonstrate that social interaction is a prerequisite for subsidiary absorptive capacity as it enables employees to participate in the transformation of new knowledge to the local context and the development of local applications. The findings also illustrate how organizational conditions at the subsidiary level can impact subsidiary absorptive capacity by enabling or constraining local interaction patterns. These insights contribute to the absorptive capacity literature by demonstrating the scale and scope of social interaction as a key link between individual- and organizational-level absorptive capacity.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the link between relative absorptive capacity and suppliers' operational performance.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses structural equation modelling of survey data from 218 Canadian manufacturers referring to a particular relationship with one of their customers.
   Findings - Results suggest that only the first dimension of the relative absorptive capacity - knowledge sharing routines - influences the knowledge transferred from the customer to the supplier. Knowledge transfer acts as a mediator between knowledge sharing routines and the supplier's operational performance improvement.
   Research limitations/implications - The absence of a significant association between the second dimension of relative absorptive capacity - overlapped knowledge bases - and knowledge transfer is a surprising result that should be further investigated.
   Originality/value - This appears to be the first study to operationalise and empirically test relative absorptive capacity and its consequences in the particular context of customer-supplier relationships.

AB Minbaeva, Pedersen, Bjorkman, Fey and Park's (2003) award-winning article highlights the importance of human resource management (HRM) practices for enhancing employees' ability and motivation to transfer knowledge - practices that, in turn, affect knowledge transfer to subsidiaries within multinational corporations (MNCs). In the decade since their laudable article was published, some contributions have been made highlighting the contingencies related to the effectiveness of HRM practices in MNCs, especially those affecting an organizations' absorptive capacity. These contingencies - the "moving parts" - include country-level differences in HR systems, cross-cultural differences in acceptance of HR practices and individual-level factors affecting the effectiveness of HRM practices. With an eye toward the future, I discuss these contingencies, paying closest attention to the effect of the individual differences affecting employees' willingness to engage in knowledge sharing. From the perspective of HRM, this year's Decade Award article opened some significant doors for future research; my goal for this commentary is to highlight them and the many that remain relatively unexplored.

AB Globally, school systems are pressed to engage in large-scale school improvement. In the United States and other countries, school district central offices and other local governing agencies often engage with external organizations and individuals to support such educational change efforts. However, initiatives with external partners are not always productive. We draw on the idea of absorptive capacity to present a conceptual framework for understanding when and under what conditions partnerships are likely to foster district learning and support change efforts. We contend that prior knowledge, communication pathways, strategic knowledge leadership, and resources to partner are preconditions for a district central office's absorptive capacity, and we identify the features of the external partner that likely matter for productive partnering. We argue that the relationship between district absorptive capacity and features of the partner is mediated by the nature of the interactions between district and partner, with likely consequences for organizational learning outcomes. For researchers, this framework serves as a tool for understanding how a district central office can learn from an external partner for educational improvement efforts. For school district leaders and external partners, this framework provides a structure for thinking strategically about when and under what conditions a partnership is likely to be productive.

AB We examine how determinants of absorptive capacity influence learning in alliances over time. Using longitudinal patent cross-citation data, we find an inverted U-shaped pattern over time that is influenced by firm-level and relational factors. Technological similarity only modestly increases learning in the initial stages of a relationship, but moderate levels substantially increase knowledge flows later in the alliance. High technological diversity is related to higher initial learning rates, but the effects diminish over time. Somewhat surprisingly, research and development intensity is negatively related to initial learning rates but has a considerable positive effect later in the relationship. We suggest that initial learning rates in alliances may be constrained by the capacity to absorb knowledge, while later-stage outcomes are constrained by exploitation capacity.

AB Knowledge management practices in architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) projects emphasize team integration and motivational factors to improve knowledge transfer among team members, many of whom come from different disciplines and organizations. However, increased knowledge transfer might raise transaction costs without bringing desired benefits if team members are not able to properly process transferred knowledge. To contribute to knowledge management practices in AEC projects, this study aims to identify key individual-level knowledge-related factors and develop indicators to measure them. Based on the literature, we identified four factors, namely knowledge application, absorptive capacity, articulating capacity, and common knowledge, and developed a set of indicators to measure them. To test the validity and reliability of these indicators, we collected data from an AEC project team including more than 160 individuals. Confirmatory factor analysis and Cronbach's alphas supported the validity and reliability of the indicators. The study's contribution to the body of knowledge is the expansion of our understanding of knowledge management practices in complex multiteam systems by considering and measuring individuals' knowledge-related factors in AEC project teams.

AB In this paper, we propose a model of national innovation production that formalizes the role of trade partnerships as a channel of knowledge spillovers across countries. The model is used to investigate the energy efficiency technological domain in the European Union (EU) using a panel database covering 19 EU countries for the time span 1990-2015. The model is estimated by using a novel empirical strategy which allows to assess the knowledge spillover effects benefiting a country depending on its relative position in the trade network, and correct for common endogeneity concerns. We show that being central in the trade network is a significant determinant of a country's innovative performance, and that learning-by-exporting mechanisms are responsible for increased innovation performances. We further reveal that neglecting network effects may significantly reduce our understanding of domestic innovation patterns. Finally, we find that the benefits obtained from knowledge diffusion varies with the domestic absorptive capacity and policy mix composition. Our main implication is that policy design informed by network-based case studies could help maximizing the exploitation of positive knowledge spillovers.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to better understand whether firm cooperation and absorptive capacity foster success in seeking public financial support for innovation activities and, by doing so, how they contribute to innovation output. Design/methodology/approach The authors therefore extend the existing literature focusing on the effects of cooperation and absorptive capacity on specific public financial support for innovation activities in Portuguese firms from local or regional government, central administration and the European Union by using available data from the Community Innovation Survey CIS 2010 and the application of logistic regression models. The empirical analysis enabled a better understanding of the positive relationship of the variables that determine the form of public financial support in the integration of incentives within firms to stimulate innovation. Findings Therefore, as the level of absorptive capacity in Portuguese firms increases, so does the demand for benefits from public financial support to stimulate innovation from the European Union also increases. The same analysis, now considering the determinant cooperation, notes the positive effects of institutional sources of information and cooperation, in the propensity for seeking public financial incentives from the Central Administration and the European Union. As for internal information and cooperation sources, they are positively related to the integration of incentive measures from the local or Regional Administration and Central Administration. Originality/value The paper presents results that allow us to propose some suggestions that both the firms and those responsible for the implementation of public policies can undertake to increment innovation performance.

AB The article aims to explore which types of proximity approach can foster university-industry (U-I) collaborations for innovation and discuss the role of different dimension regional absorptive capacity in cooperation to promote inter-regional partnerships from "unbalance" to "coordination". Therefore, we intercept 484 pairs of cooperative entities and analyze proximity effects and heterogeneity cross-regional U-I collaborations by hierarchical regression. The results show: (1) In non-local contexts, geographic distance is not a hamper for improving innovation performance. The economic development level has no significantly different effects on such a role. (2) Technological proximity plays a negative role in increasing innovative performance, and the eastern region has the most noticeable results. (3) The closer in social distance can get more innovation performance in eastern and western, but the central area negatively affects. (4) The U-I collaborations for innovation performance-enhancing advantages are not equal for all regions but are moderating by specific regional absorptive capacity dimensions. The areas with a higher level of internal human capital can get more catch-up effects. The lagging regions should increase talents to promote cross-regional cooperation for catching up. In contrast, the prosperous areas should take advantage of the talent-gathering effects to promote knowledge spillover.

This research reviews literature at the intersection of knowledge spillovers, entrepreneurship, and regional economic development. The key argument is that entrepreneurship can serve as a mechanism for transmitting knowledge spillovers and accordingly contribute to regional innovation, cluster formation, and economic development. However, the effectiveness of this mechanism depends on various factors in the regional entrepreneurial ecosystem, notably including knowledge bases, absorptive capacity, competition, networks of people, diversity, and culture.

AB What are the driving factors of disruptive innovations in emerging economies from a network perspective? We argue that three forms of absorptive capacity (i.e. exploratory, exploitative and transformative learning) mediate the relationship between a firm's network relations and disruptive innovations. We tested the hypotheses with a survey of 251 firms in China and iterated the conceptual model to reflect the crucial insight that disrupters in emerging economies can leap from exploratory learning to disruptive innovation. We surmise exploratory learning help disrupters outsource transformative and exploitative learning via their supply chains. Suggestions for future research and limitations are also discussed.

AB Drawing on a network perspective on organizational learning, I argue that organizational units can produce more innovations and enjoy better performance if they occupy central network positions that provide access to new knowledge developed by other units. This effect, however, depends on units' absorptive capacity, or ability to successfully replicate new knowledge. Data from 24 business units in a petrochemical company and 36 business units in a food-manufacturing company show that the interaction between absorptive capacity and network position has significant, positive effects on business unit innovation and performance.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the influence of social capital on competitive advantage through collective learning and absorptive capacity.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study carries out analyses based on structural equation modeling to measure the main constructs and test the hypothesized relationships among the variables. The primary statistical technique for assessing survey data collected from 358 Taiwan tenants is partial least squares analysis.
   Findings - Collective learning and absorptive capacity fully mediate the relationship between social capital and competitive advantage. Moreover, social capital has a significant influence on both collective learning and absorptive capacity.
   Practical implications - Tenant firms in industrial parks must develop effective management tactics for the nurturing of inter-firm relations to enhance collective learning and their absorptive capacity to acquire and exploit key strategic resources such as tacit and explicit knowledge. For specialized firms, close social interactions in specific contexts, mediated by collective learning and absorptive capacity to make up for their resource constraints, can heighten their competitive advantage.
   Originality/value - By demonstrating the impact of social capital on competitive advantage in the specific context of industrial parks, whose artificial environment encourages and promotes close social interactions among tenants, this paper overcomes previous and contradictory findings regarding the relationship between social capital and competitive advantage. A key contingent factor is the mediating role of collective learning and absorptive capacity.

AB In this work we explore the role of interfirm R&D alliances as a vital mechanism for creating new technological knowledge. Drawing on the absorptive capacity perspective, we argue that firms with a high level of such capacity seem to benefit more from their alliances. Specifically, three indicators of technology strategy relevant to absorptive capacity, including proportion of R&D alliances in an alliance portfolio, technological distance, and R&D intensity are explored to examine their impacts on innovation performance. Using alliance data from the Securities Data Company (SDC), patent data from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), firm data from S&P COMPUSTAT, and co-patents granted as a proxy for the alliance innovation performance, these results show that while alliance networks potentially provide a firm with access to various benefits that can help in creating new technologies, R&D alliances in particular are more suitable than other types of partnerships to achieve this aim. Furthermore, given that information transfer and learning are key benefits of R&D alliances, moderate technological distance is needed if such alliances are to be successful. In particular, the innovation performance peaks at the moderate level of technological distance with alliance partners when this interacts with the proportion of R&D alliances in a firm's alliance portfolio. Finally, R&D alliances should be regarded as a complement to rather than a substitute for a firm's internal R&D. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Complementing received research on the role of collaboration networks in fostering interorganizational learning and innovation, the authors focus on the importance of learning from other firms' public knowledge. To this end they introduce the concept of spillover network-the network of "source" firms whose public knowledge a "recipient" firm is able to readily absorb and use as innovation input. Using patent-based data on a panel of semiconductor firms between 1976 and 2002, the authors demonstrate that firms' innovative performance tends to be higher when their spillover network is either munificent or rich in structural holes. However, being exposed to a spillover network that is both munificent and rich in structural holes is generally counterproductive. Consistent with the insight that the value of external knowledge inputs depends on the firm-level resources with which it can be bundled, furthermore, the authors argue that the extent to which firms benefit from their spillover network hinges on specific intraorganizational factors-their scientific intensity and degree of downstream integration.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a better understanding of the process used by organizations to leverage external knowledge. A model of the knowledge leveraging process is developed, which hypothesizes joint sensemaking is a key antecedent to both explicit and tacit knowledge exchange, a dual role for explicit knowledge exchange (i.e. as an antecedent of both tacit knowledge exchange and absorptive capacity) and absorptive capacity is a key mediator between knowledge exchange (both explicit and tacit) and organizational innovativeness.
   Design/methodology/approach - The hypothesized model is tested using survey data gathered from over 230 Chinese companies. The results from the analysis of the hypothesized model are compared to ones from a theory-based rival model. The analyses are performed using partial least squares analysis.
   Findings - The results suggest key roles for both joint sensemaking and absorptive capacity in the knowledge exchange process. In addition, our findings provide evidence regarding the interplay between explicit and tacit knowledge exchange and their role in the knowledge leveraging process.
   Research limitations/implications - The cross-sectional nature of the study provides limited inferences regarding causality. In addition, organizational innovativeness is measured using self-reported, subjective assessments. However, the results provide valuable insights into the knowledge leveraging process.
   Practical implications - The study increases our understanding of how organizations leverage external knowledge to improve organizational innovativeness. In addition, it provides specific guidance for managers interested in leveraging external knowledge.
   Originality/value - Knowledge and knowledge management issues are receiving increased attention in the marketing literature. However, due to the complexity involved in transferring and using external knowledge, our understanding of the processes involved is limited. Our study provides some insights regarding how firms leverage external knowledge and therefore should be of interest to both researchers and practitioners.

AB Despite the importance of knowledge complementarities to inter-firm cooperation, few researchers in information systems (IS) have examined, to date, the construct of knowledge complementarities (KC), and none have examined its role in the success of IT outsourcing alliances. In this paper, we distinguish between potential knowledge complementarities (PKC) and synergistic value, which comprise KC. PKC is conceptualized as a multidimensional construct encompassing knowledge types (similar and specialized) and knowledge domains (business and IT). Further, we examine the extent to which PKC between the client and the vendor promotes success in IT outsourcing alliances. This research also includes relative absorptive capacity because it is relevant when complementary knowledge flows between organizations. We used data from a field study of 81 firms in Korea to test the proposed model. Our findings indicate that each dimension of PKC contributes uniquely to knowledge complementarities. The results also show that PKC is significantly associated with IT outsourcing effectiveness. Relative absorptive capacity is found to be a moderator between PKC and IT outsourcing effectiveness. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed in the paper.

   CONTENTS
AB Absorptive capacity has been marked as one of the most important capabilities of Multinational Corporations for effective management of knowledge. To address calls for research on micro-level origins of the concept, this paper focuses on the determinants of individual-level absorptive capacity. We examine the extent to which individuals' capability to recognize, assimilate and exploit new knowledge from the environment is shaped by different forms of work motivation (i.e., intrinsic and extrinsic), overall ability, exposure to diverse country contexts and personal characteristics. Drawing on and extending the Motivation-Ability-Opportunity framework, we develop and test a set of hypotheses. Using a unique dataset collected from 648 individuals in a multinational corporation, we show that individuals' intrinsic motivation and overall ability are the key antecedents of absorptive capacity. In contrast, extrinsic motivation does not emerge as a significant predictor. We find that past international assignments to distant countries could be detrimental to individuals' absorptive capacity. However, our results suggest that for those individuals who are open to new experiences, assignments to distant countries become useful opportunity for absorptive capacity development. These findings contribute to existing literature by showing effects of alternative types of motivation and underscoring the importance of using selective assignment when considering exposure to diverse country context as a tool for employee capability development.

AB Effective knowledge management is important to the success of information technology projects. This research applies the integrated lens of the absorptive capacity theory and the social process model of information system development projects to examine the dynamic of knowledge activities concerning broadband infrastructure development in the context of municipal broadband networks. The research questions are: (1) What is the extent of the dynamic of knowledge activities involved in the development process?, (2) What are the events that trigger knowledge activities in municipal broadband development?, and (3) How does a city create and utilize new knowledge in the development process? This study examines municipal wireless projects in three cities (Chaska, MN; Hermosa Beach, CA; and Fredericton, Canada). Events that trigger knowledge activities are assignment of personnel, physical system construction, performance problems, resistance, and reassignment of organizational roles. Four factors that influence knowledge activities and project performance are the dynamic of technology development, partnership commitments, limitation of external knowledge and learning-by-doing, and political dynamics. The study has policy implications for cities that are in the process of planning and deployment. A good project planning, user expectation management, systematic performance evaluation, a careful partner selection process, and the use of service level agreements are important to project success. In addition, cities need to take into consideration that the technology is not a plug and play technology and that considerable efforts are needed to integrate the technology with other solutions to deliver broadband services as well as to configure the system according to topologies, street conditions, buildings, density of trees, among others.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate how resource-constrained, knowledge-intensive firms capitalise on the knowledge from collaboration with big-science centres. It pays particular attention to what kind of knowledge a firm obtains and how it can be efficiently used in exploring and exploiting opportunities in international markets. Design/methodology/approach The empirical basis for the study is a longitudinal case study of knowledge-intensive Estonian companies that collaborate with the European Space Agency (ESA). A rich data set was collected over three years. Findings By studying the inward and outward activities of the two case companies collaborating with the ESA, the authors found that the internationalisation process of these firms had unique characteristics. Their international expansion was not driven by increasing market knowledge and reducing risk or uncertainty, but by resource seeking for research and development efforts. It was a cyclical, non-linear process, which was advanced by co-creation, learning and exploitation of the emergent knowledge, leading to an improved network position and identification of further opportunities. Research limitations/implications The focus was on knowledge-intensive, resource-constrained firms and their collaboration with big-science centres. The transfer of the proposed framework to another context may not be straightforward. The authors relied on informants from the firms, thus ignoring the view of their partner, the big-science centre. It may be that because of this perspective, the authors did not capture some aspects of the collaboration. A broader range of cases would have provided more powerful support to the findings. Although the cases were sufficient for theory refinement and building a tentative framework, they also call for further cases that would clarify whether these conclusions would be valid for other companies. Practical implications Collaboration with big-science centres provides companies with access to diverse types of knowledge. However, its impact on the future success in internationalisation also depends on other factors, such as the firm's absorptive capacity and technological competence. Social implications Governments invest substantially on the development of big-science centres with the expectation that they would have significant knowledge spillovers on the technology development. A more qualitative approach to impact assessment opens new ideas how to develop their activities and in particular their collaboration with SMEs. Originality/value The study reassesses the theory on the internationalisation process of the firm and gives voice to companies which have been marginalised in earlier research.

AB In this article, we examine how the multinational enterprise (MNE) develops the ability to function as a multilingual entity in order to facilitate communication, knowledge transfer, and absorptive capacity. While we acknowledge the role played by the adoption of a common corporate language, we argue that this response alone is insufficient to cope with the diverse foreign language demands that accompany global expansion. MNEs need what we conceptualize as language operative capacity (LOC): language resources that have been assembled and deployed in a context-relevant and timely manner throughout the MNE's global network. Language resources are mainly derived from human and social capital, and their interaction, to form what is termed language capital. Managerial motivation and a preparedness to act are necessary to ensure that language capital is converted into LOC. Our theoretical explanation of LOC derivation is multilevel, incorporating two interacting processes: individuals develop, maintain, and contribute their own foreign language resources, but the MNE also plays a key role. It can influence individual behavior and, at the organizational level, provide its own language resources through the provision of computerized translation software and the like. The interaction between these two processes is seen to be critical in the formation and use of LOC. This multilevel explanation contributes to the growing body of literature that considers how human capital resources in general can be converted for productive purposes.

AB This paper focuses on the effects of absorptive capacity and coopetition on the generation of product innovation, by making use of a sample of manufacturing firms, both high-tech and medium-low-tech, from Italy and Portugal. For this purpose, we use two datasets of 4,912 Italian manufacturing firms and 3,660 Portuguese manufacturing firms that participated in the European Community Innovation Survey (CIS) 2010. A logit analysis is conducted for high-tech firms and medium-low-tech firms and the results reveal that for both types of firms, the absorptive capacity enablers of Italian manufacturing firms, such as internal R&D, external R&D and employee expertise have a positive and significant effect on the generation of product innovation. In addition, the establishment of coopetition relationships with Italian competitors denotes a positive and significant effect on the generation of product innovation. For the Portuguese manufacturing firms, both high-tech and medium-low-tech, we find that the absorptive capacity enablers mentioned above have a positive and significant effect on the generation of product innovation. In addition, the formation of coopetition relationships with Portuguese competitors also presents a positive and significant effect on the generation of product innovation.

AB Even with the rich literature on knowledge management, we still don't know enough about how the rate of change in production-know-how affects the choice of mechanisms for its transfer. Codifying tacit know-how helps, but codification becomes more challenging as the know-how changes more frequently. Transfer of tacit know-how becomes much more complicated when it changes often. We need more research in this area, particularly to help production and operations managers who must ultimately use the new know-how and change their companies' production processes.
   The paper suggests a framework as a step in that direction. The framework focuses on the interplay between the level of codification and the rate of change of production know-how, and identifies four zones for classifying production know-how: "slow and codified," "slow and tacit," "fast and codified," and "fast and tacit." Examples from McDonald's, Club Med, Intel, and AOL are used to illustrate primary transfer mechanisms for each zone (manuals and systems, people, joint-development, and projects, respectively). Appropriate absorptive capacities in the production units for each zone are also identified. Since the ultimate responsibility of operations managers is to improve (i.e., change) their production know-how as fast as possible, they would be wise to adopt policies that are closer to those suited for the "fast and codified" zone. Intel and Toyota show good models.

AB In addition to internal R&D, external knowledge is widely considered as an essential lever for innovative performance. This paper analyzes knowledge spillovers in supply chain networks. Specifically, we investigate how supplier innovation is impacted by buyer innovation. Financial accounting data is combined with supply chain relationship data and patent data for U.S. firms in high tech industries. Our econometric analysis shows that buyer innovation has a positive and significant impact on supplier innovation. We find that the duration of the buyer-supplier relationship positively moderates this effect, but that the technological proximity between the two firms does not have a significant effect on spillovers.

AB This study has analyzed how the network structure (density, centrality) affects the performance (convergence, overall) in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) with the different business exchange activities. In addition, we conducted a moderating effect of absorptive capacity (ability, motivation). Based on previous literature about the network and absorptive capacity, research hypotheses were developed and tested using a sample of 226 SMEs in South Korea. The results show that network density and centrality have a positive effect on perceived convergence and overall performance. These results are consistent with previous network studies relating to structural characteristics. To raise total performances in firms with different business exchange activities, they need to enhance density and centrality. For example, firms with different business exchange activities and high levels of density and centrality are able to easily obtain various types of information from other members of 7000 firms in Korea. Through this, they can improve performance. We also conducted the moderated regression analysis. The results show that employee ability has a positive moderating effect on the relationship between centrality and the overall performance while employee motivation has a negative moderating effect. The implications and directions for future study along with limitations are presented.

AB Knowledge has been recognised as a source of competitive advantage. Knowledge-based resources allow organisations to adapt products and services to the marketplace and deal with competitive challenges that enable them to compete more effectively. One factor critical to using knowledge-based resources is the ability to transfer knowledge as a dimension of the learning organisation. There are many elements that may influence whether knowledge transfer can be effectively achieved in an organisation such as leadership, problem-solving behaviours, support structures, change management capabilities, absorptive capacity and the nature of the knowledge. An existing framework was applied in a case study to explain how knowledge transfer can be managed effectively and to identify emerging issues or additional factors involved in the process. As a result, a refined framework is proposed that provides a better understanding for the effective management of knowledge transfer processes that can provide a competitive advantage.

AB Purpose - Building on the social network view and new product development perspective, the purpose of this paper is to examine how knowledge is transferred between identical, yet geographically distant units within a multinational corporation.
   Design/methodology/approach - An embedded case study of Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW) examining core drivers that impact on inter-unit knowledge transfers between six events and exhibitions (E&E) units located in Europe, Asia, and Australasia.
   Findings - The data highlight that effective knowledge transfer between E&E units depends on a combination of key drivers, such as social network ties, absorptive capacity, learning adaptiveness, and communication channels. The findings suggest that the search for and transfer of knowledge depends foremost on the applicability of context-specific knowledge rather than its complexity.
   Research limitations/implications - The focus is on one specific manufacturing sector and specific drivers to knowledge transfer in this sector, limiting the generalisation of the findings. Also, the findings were drawn from a limited sample of In-depth practitioner interviews and did not integrate any outcome measures to successful knowledge transfer in their approach.
   Practical implications - The paper offers guidelines for firms and specifically E&E managers to observe the specificity of knowledge and how this affects its limited applicability for other identical units.
   Originality/value - Managers foremost need is to examine the unique context under which knowledge is acquired; only then are they in a position to decide how much knowledge transfer via different network and communication channels is needed between geographically dispersed E&E units.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop and test an integrated model to examine the relationship between managerial ties and two types of open innovation (OI). It takes into account the mediating role of realized absorptive capacity and explains how a firm's ability to recognize the value of new information, assimilate it and apply it to commercial ends can facilitate OI.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 259 middle and top managers working across different sectors in the United Arab Emirates.
   Findings - Results obtained using structural equation modeling show that managerial ties facilitate both in-bound and out-bound OI. Results also establish the mediating role of realized absorptive capacity in these relationships.
   Research limitations/implications - Use of cross-sectional data as was done in this study has been criticized for being inappropriate to test causal models. Besides the findings may not be generalizable to different industries/cultures/regions.
   Practical implications - This study suggests that managerial ties act to support OI in firms thus giving the insight that managers should be appreciated to build ties with managers of other firms, universities and government officials. Doing so can help firms achieve better OI outcomes. Firms should arrange means of interaction of their managers with these external knowledge sources such as events and occasions where managers of different firms can interact with each other to foster strong ties among them.
   Originality/value - The above findings contribute theoretically to OI and managerial ties literature while providing insights for practitioners on how to succeed or avoid failure in their OI initiatives. These insights are novel and are new to the OI and managerial ties theory.

AB The convergence of technology upgrading such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and digital and social networking platforms provides new directions and solutions for companies. The proposed research seeks to capitalise on and critically interrogate such convergence, how it works and the challenges connectivity brings for internal local life and external global markets of small to medium enterprises (SMEs). SMEs have been considered the most innovative oriented businesses in developed countries even in emerging markets acting as pioneer in the digital transformational word.
   It has been widely recognised that local SMEs can get advantages from multinational enterprises spillover. However, studies on the horizontal technology spillover between SMEs are scarce. In fact, there is a need to explore the effect of horizontal technology spillover on SMEs for international growth. Therefore, the research offers quantitative metrics such as technology upgrading, knowledge spillover, and technology transfer to explore this effect in the Chinese market. Especially, the empirical research is conducted on a sample of 80 SMEs in Beijing from technology intensive industry. It critically interrogates how digital, social and transformational technologies impacts SMEs' competitiveness to produce points of digital convergence that connect, co-create and drive local to international growth via structural equation modelling.

AB While supplier development has become a prominent strategy, it has also been shown to not always be successful. We take a contingency perspective in the present research to investigate why this may be the case. Unlike most prior studies, we examine the issue from the viewpoint of the supplier as the recipient of buyer-driven knowledge transfer, and assess factors that may attenuate or hamper its effect on the supplier's operational performance. We suggest, basing our arguments on the theoretical framework of motivation-opportunity-ability (MOA), that while buyer-driven knowledge transfer activities provide an opportunity for enhancing the supplier's operational performance, the degree to which this opportunity is realized depends upon both the relative absorptive capacity (ability), as well as the supplier's trust in the buyer, and the supplier's innovativeness (motivation). Specifically, we theorize that the supplier's perceived overlapping knowledge and its perceived cognitive congruence with the buyer (reflective of the supplier's relative absorptive capacity) and the supplier's trust in the buyer serve as positive moderators, and the supplier's own innovativeness as a negative moderator. We assess these hypotheses within a unique context, namely that of small- and medium-sized suppliers of large South Korean conglomerates (so-called chaebols), using hierarchical linear modeling. Our findings extend the academic literature in supplier development by providing insight into important contingencies influencing the effectiveness of buyer-driven knowledge transfer activities for improved operational performance of suppliers, based on the MOA framework, and offer valuable lessons for practitioners in crafting more effective supplier development strategies.

AB This study analyzes the impact of local linkages, international linkages, and absorptive capacity on firm innovation for firms based in one emerging economy while operating in another emerging economy. Testing research hypotheses derived from the institutional and organizational learning perspectives on a sample of 102 Taiwanese manufacturing firms operating in China, we find that the impact of international linkages is greater than that of local linkages, while both local and international linkages have a positive impact on innovation. Further analysis confirms that absorptive capacity has a stronger moderating effect on the relationship between local linkages and innovation than it does on the relationship between international linkages and innovation.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a process model for knowledge transfer in using theories relating knowledge communication and knowledge translation.
   Design/methodology/approach - Most of what is put forward in this paper is based on a research project titled "Procurement for innovation and knowledge transfer (ProFIK)". The project is funded by a UK government research council - The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). The discussions are mainly grounded on a thorough review of literature accomplished as part of the research project.
   Findings - The process model developed in this paper has built upon the theory of knowledge transfer and the theory of communication. Knowledge transfer, per se, is not a mere transfer of knowledge. It involves different stages of knowledge transformation. Depending on the context of knowledge transfer, it can also be influenced by many factors; some positive and some negative. The developed model of knowledge transfer attempts to encapsulate all these issues in order to create a holistic framework.
   Originality/value of paper - An attempt has been made in the paper to combine some of the significant theories or findings relating to knowledge transfer together, making the paper an original and valuable one.

AB Previous research has predominantly taken a social network perspective suggesting that building more network connections or becoming deeply embedded in a network provides a better position to access network knowledge in open source software communities. This perspective implicitly assumes that accessed network knowledge automatically gets absorbed and transferred to projects, so that building more and deeper network connections is beneficial: Drawing from an absorptive capacity perspective, this research challenges such conventional wisdom, arguing instead that the benefits depend on a project's absorptive capacity. Network connections provide access to external knowledge in the community; the absorption and transfer of this new knowledge require appropriate internal knowledge and developer roles. With longitudinal data collected from 4,518 open source software development projects hosted at Source-Forge, the authors show that knowledge breadth (depth) helps with the absorption of external knowledge achieved from network depth (breadth), but it inhibits the absorption of external knowledge obtained from network breadth (depth). Further, developer roles (e.g., bridge members, role diversity) can mitigate the negative consequences of suboptimal combinations and facilitate effective transfers of absorbed external knowledge across and within projects. These findings provide important theoretical and managerial implications for managing network connections, knowledge, and developer roles in open source software communities.

AB This paper analyses how the internal resources of small-and medium-sized enterprises determine access (learning processes) to technology centres (TCs) or industrial research institutes (innovation infrastructure) in traditional low-tech clusters. These interactions basically represent traded (market-based) transactions, which constitute important sources of knowledge in clusters. The paper addresses the role of TCs in low-tech clusters, and uses semi-structured interviews with 80 firms in a manufacturing cluster. The results point out that producer-user interactions are the most frequent; thus, the higher the sector knowledge-intensive base, the more likely the utilization of the available research infrastructure becomes. Conversely, the sectors with less knowledge-intensive structures, i.e. less absorptive capacity (AC), present weak linkages to TCs, as they frequently prefer to interact with suppliers, who act as transceivers of knowledge. Therefore, not all the firms in a cluster can fully exploit the available research infrastructure, and their AC moderates this engagement. In addition, the existence of TCs is not sufficient since the active role of a firm's search strategies to undertake interactions and conduct openness to available sources of knowledge is also needed. The study has implications for policymakers and academia.

AB This paper investigates the influence of research and development (R&D) cooperation on the creation of spillover effects for sustainable firms in the chemical industry. We explore the evidence for the origin of knowledge spillovers derived from cooperation amongst firms and universities and R&D organizations as well as to test the influence of internal/external financial support on these effects. The results confirm that when firms acquire knowledge from internal sources, this leads to increased innovation and sustainable performance. We have proved that internal expenditure results in increased internal knowledge spillovers. These findings may be specific for Central and Eastern (CEE) transition countries, indicating their efforts to build path-dependent structures based on knowledge institutions and businesses as well as knowledge networks. However, this study also provides a more "global" contribution to the knowledge spillover effect theory. It shows that a firm's cooperation both with universities and with other firms promotes different types of knowledge spillovers and can affect diverse modes of sustainable activities in innovation.

AB Many organizations support online communities of practice (OCOPs) as part of their knowledge management strategies. Despite some prior investigation of the potential benefits of OCOPs, the effects of OCOPs on behaviors and performance outcomes are not well understood. Drawing on social capital theory and absorptive capacity literature, this paper addresses three research questions: (1) How does social capital influence exchange and combination behaviors in online communities of practice? (2) How do exchange and combination behaviors affect the performance of individuals and the OCOP? (3) How does absorptive capacity moderate the impact of exchange and combination behaviors on individual and OCOP performance? The empirical study is based on online survey data from 253 participants in OCOPs and qualitative analysis of online postings. The results indicate that cognitive and structural capital facilitate exchange and combination behaviors in OCOPs, but relational capital does not. Moreover, exchange and combination behaviors facilitate the performance of individuals as well as the OCOP, and a higher level of absorptive capacity enhances these effects. The findings are discussed in detail, along with their theoretical and practical implications, and directions for future research. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper identifies practices that can facilitate knowledge transfer in university-industry (U-I) research partnerships by systematically reviewing extant literature. We aim to contribute to the theoretical development in the field of academic engagement and propose that knowledge transfer provides a valuable perspective. We started our review with identifying barriers and facilitators of knowledge transfer. Extant literature identified knowledge differences and differences in goals resulting from different institutional cultures as important barriers to knowledge transfer. They result in ambiguity, problems with knowledge absorption and difficulties with the application of knowledge. Trust, communication, the use of intermediaries and experience are found as facilitators for knowledge transfer that help to resolve the identified barriers. Our analysis offers practical advice for the management of academic engagement. Finally, we identified questions for future research based on inconsistencies in extant research and open questions we encountered during our analysis.

AB Technological merger and acquisition (M&A) has become an increasingly popular mode of innovation for firms. We investigate the determinants of innovation creation through technological M&As. Based on the concept of relative absorptive capacity, the study examines how the acquiring firm absorbs and assimilates the knowledge of the acquired firm and creates innovation. Specifically, the technological M&As are examined by presenting dyadic perspective variables, including technological similarity and technological digestibility which affect the assimilation, transformation, and exploitation processes of the absorptive capacity. We additionally investigate the role of M&A experience as a moderator of dyadic characteristics and innovation performance of technological M&As. Two hundred and twelve cases of technological M&As in the biopharmaceutical industry from 1993 to 2007 are investigated using zero-inflated negative binomial regression and negative binomial regression. The findings confirm a positive effect of acquiring small firms having a modest level of similar knowledge on post-M&A innovation performance. Moreover, this study highlights the importance of the dyadic perspective in advancing the understanding of technological M&A.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore how China's manufacturers catch up with the forerunners through R&D cooperation by developing a new mode of latecomer-forerunner R&D cooperation, i.e. the periphery-core mode, which provides a viable way for China's manufacturers to obtain forerunners' core knowledge from their periphery knowledge via knowledge spillover and knowledge transfer.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper first reviews the literature on R&D cooperation process in the catching- up context and knowledge management in R&D cooperation. Then, three cases of R&D cooperation between China's advanced technology manufacturers and their forerunners are introduced, with emphasis on interactivities in R&D cooperation and knowledge spillover. On the basis of the multi-case study, the periphery-core mode of R&D cooperation between latecomers and forerunners is conducted.
   Findings - The paper finds that the latecomers can catch up with their forerunners by acquiring forerunners' core technology used in periphery R&D activities. Through formal and informal interactions, the forerunners' core technology can be extracted and transferred to latecomers, which the latecomers can then absorb and further develop. Thus, it can be concluded that the periphery-core mode of R&D cooperation is a viable way for the latecomers to get access to forerunners' core technology.
   Originality/value - The paper contributes to the literature on the catching- up theory by developing the periphery-core mode as a new mode for the latecomers to catch up with the forerunners. It expands the understanding of the latecomer-forerunner R&D cooperation by focusing on the way that China's manufacturers as latecomers catch up with the forerunners by accessing the forerunners' core knowledge from their R&D cooperation in periphery knowledge. The paper shows the mechanism of knowledge transfer and spillover in R&D cooperation. The role of communications, especially informal communication between cooperation partners, is emphasized in this process. This study also provides a new perspective for cooperation partner selection by arguing that latecomers can choose their cooperation partners according to the periphery and core knowledge they possess, other than the relationship between them. Besides, this paper emphasizes the mutual support between knowledge transfer, knowledge spillover and knowledge absorption, which is necessary for latecomers to achieve successful catching up in periphery-core R&D cooperation.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) modelling was applied to the study of RIS structure, aiming to identify the 'hidden' mediating variables that may influence the overall effect of GRI on economic and employment growth. In general, Absorptive Capacity, is the most rapid and balanced development strategy for regions characterised by environments, which are adverse to change and innovation, and characterized by low industrialization and income levels.

AB Using data from 1986-2005, the present paper estimates the impact of direct knowledge spilled over from G-7 countries on China's economy. We use telephone line penetration rates and personnel flows to estimate the direct spillover effect. Our results show that direct knowledge spillovers through telecommunication networks and personnel flows are important components of international R&D spillovers in China. These direct channels of spillover effectively accelerate China's economic growth. Therefore, China should invest more in human capital and in its telecommunication network to enhance the absorptive capacity of direct R&D spillovers, and to increase communication with other nations, in particular the USA and Japan. More subsidies to domestic R&D research and purchase of intermediate goods will help to raise China's R&D intensity.

AB Social networks are increasingly considered to be influential in explaining the knowledge transfer process. Despite scholarly efforts to integrate knowledge transfer and social network research, we lack understanding on how knowledge transfer networks emerge and evolve. We draw upon resource dependency theory and inter-organizational networks and collect patent data of 42 Double-First Class (DFC) universities to study structural properties of the Chinese university knowledge transfer network over time. Our results point to the existence of an increasingly complex yet remarkably efficient network. Universities and co-patent collaborations emerge in the network and act as knowledge bridges between other universities. The network moves from an early-stage single-centered network to a mature multi-centered network through a power-law pattern. Such movement allows for an aggregation phenomenon to appear as oligopolistic communities emerge and rule the network. While knowledge is more easily shared and accessible within communities, their existence also brings along control over knowledge bases embedded in those communities. Key universities take central positions within the expanding network, which allows them to gain control and easier access to knowledge. It also hints that it might be difficult for other DFC universities to become key players in the network. On an inter-regional level, our findings point to steadily increasing knowledge transfer activity, which is key to overcome the underdevelopment of some Chinese regions. Overall, this paper contributes to our understanding on the theoretical connection between knowledge transfer and social network dynamics, on how universities evolve through knowledge transfer networks, and on how their embeddedness translates into knowledge control, knowledge access, and knowledge bridges.

AB This paper examines the effect of agglomeration economies on firm productivity and the role of absorptive capacity in China. Taking into account the transitioning economy context, I further exploit the gradual and spatially uneven implementation of market-oriented reforms to track the relative importance of firms' absorptive capacity for economic catch-up. The three main results are as follows. First, firms exhibit higher productivity when located in an area with a denser network of related activities, particularly for firms with higher absorptive capacity. Second, the sources of the productivity gains are driven by externalities that arise from better access to inputs, similar workers and technological-related knowledge spillovers. Third, the role of absorptive capacity becomes more important for boosting productivity following more versus less intensive market-oriented economic reforms. These findings have important policy implications for transitioning economies and suggest that market reforms promote efficiency improvements related to performing actual R&D as well as encourage firms to seek out external sources of knowledge in order to attain market competitiveness.

AB The paper identifies and evaluates the antecedents, contextual factors and inter-organisational processes that influence knowledge transfer in international hotel master franchise agreements and how these evolve from the perspective of both franchisors and franchisees. A single, purposively selected in-depth qualitative case study reveals the specific factors relevant to knowledge transfer at different stages of the franchise agreement. Drawing on the alliance literature, the impact of four partner-specific variables on inter-organisational design processes used to transfer knowledge and on three antecedents to knowledge transfer; shared identity, absorptive capacity and casual ambiguity is identified. The study contributes to our understanding of the dynamics and evolution of knowledge transfer in master franchise agreements by highlighting the relative importance of partner-specific variables and relational management to knowledge transfer evolution and the relative importance of shared identity as an antecedent to knowledge transfer in these agreements (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach This study uses qualitative and grounded theory techniques to collect and analyze data from a franchise network based in Africa. This approach enables the triangulation of data from different sources including field visits, observation, interviews and company reports. Findings The findings suggest that training is the most preferred mechanisms for transferring localized knowledge. The results highlight the importance of identifying franchisees' training needs for transferring relevant knowledge according to experience and market profile of franchisees. Additionally, a collaborative environment within the network facilitates the sharing of best practices. Research limitations/implications Data/insight from Africa in this study provides both theoretical and practical implications. Propositions presented can help advance KT and franchise research. Originality/value Franchising and knowledge management research in emerging markets especially in Africa is rare. This paper provides valuable insights for understanding KT practices in the African franchise market.

AB It is known that global flagships' capacity and willingness to transfer knowledge in global production networks will affect the knowledge acquisition of local firms. However, the mechanism is not clear enough, or rather scattered, and thus lacks an integrated model for comprehensive conceptualization. Adopting a sample of 105 Chinese firms, we construct an integrated two-stage model to interpret the mechanism of knowledge transfer from global flagships to local firms and find that global flagships' capacity and willingness to transfer positively impact the knowledge acquired by local firms through the mediation of the knowledge contributed by the global flagships. Organizational distance and local firms' absorptive capacity affect the knowledge acquired by local firms as well. The influences of the latter two also depend on the different types of ties between global flagships and local firms.

AB Building information modelling (BIM) has been adopted with increasing frequency by the construction industry in the last few years due to its potential to enhance construction business performance. While there is a general belief that higher BIM proficiency will lead to higher business performance, few empirical studies have tested this relationship. This research explores the extent to which a positive relationship exists between BIM adoption and organisational learning. The impact of BIM maturity and years of experience on the absorptive capacity (AC) of contractors to adopt new information for organisational learning is investigated through a survey of Australian building contractors. While BIM experience was found to be a significant predictor for contractor AC, the analysis of variance showed no significant relationship between BIM maturity and AC. The literature indicates a pervasive belief in a potent relationship between BIM maturity and organisational learning, yet it seems that factors traditionally viewed as more peripheral play a bigger role than expected in determining the impact of BIM on learning and business performance. Subsequent interviews found that (1) poor business ties, (2) willingness to share information and (3) organisational cultural values weaken the expected relationship between BIM maturity and AC. The results suggest that the extent of an organisation's experience with BIM is a greater predictor of learning performance than the complexity of BIM usage within the organisation. The main contribution of this paper is to reveal the complexity surrounding the relationship between BIM and business performance.

AB Transferring lean knowledge is crucial for multinational companies; however, it is very difficult. Nevertheless, our knowledge in the area is limited. This paper investigates (a) how lean knowledge is transferred within multinational networks and (b) the type of organizational context that supports it. We use four case studies with 18 interviews in our exploratory study. Our results indicate that companies use a sophisticated knowledge transfer system with a fine web of practices that serve to transfer both explicit and tacit knowledge. The revealed organizational contexts show different patterns of division of labour (and responsibilities) between a central lean office and the particular subsidiary's lean office. Our findings highlight the importance of transfer coalition, which consists of the cooperation of lean experts and top management during the knowledge transfer process. Top managers play a key role with their weak inter-unit ties, and they provide guidance for lean efforts and allocate sufficient resources to them. Further findings show that the evolution of lean transitions is not linear, and each of our case companies has witnessed turnaround during their journey.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate how R&D originality functions in an open innovation process after the introduction of knowledge spillovers (KSs). Design/methodology/approach To examine the research framework, the authors use hierarchical regression based on questionnaire data from 211 emerging enterprises in China. Findings Consistent with the proposed framework, the authors find that the KS effect mediates the positive relationship between openness and innovation performance. In addition, R&D originality weakens the impact of the KS effect on innovation performance. Research limitations/implications One limitation is that the questionnaire survey the authors choose for data collection has some natural defects; furthermore, the testing method and research framework need to be improved. Practical implications Several implications of the findings for managerial practices are discussed. Originality/value First, the research expands the existing theoretical construct by introducing the KS effect into the open innovation process; second, the authors reveal the negative impact of R&D originality on the open innovation process.

AB School district central offices regularly engage with external partners in improvement efforts, but these partnerships are not always productive. Indeed, little is known about under what conditions partnerships are likely to lead to organizational learning outcomes. We conducted a longitudinal comparative case study of two departments in one urban school district central office, both working with the same external partner. Data included 131 interviews and 372 hours of observations as well as artifacts and social network data. While one department did not incorporate the partner's ideas into policies and routines, the other demonstrated greater integration. We argue this difference is due to organizational conditions that foster absorptive capacity and to the nature of department-partner interactions.

AB Purpose Studies have shown that organizations that are capable of effectively transferring knowledge are often more productive than others. At the same time, there is increasing ambiguity regarding how the nature of knowledge transfer affects performance. The purpose of this paper is to review the literature on the nature of knowledge transfer and to understand why it remains a hindrance to most organizations, even now. This conceptual paper tries to identify the major debates surrounding the nature of knowledge transfer in an organization. The challenges and opportunities facing research on knowledge transfer are also elaborated. Design/methodology/approach This conceptual paper is structured to first provide a brief summary of the construct of knowledge transfer and then provide a detailed account of research that highlights the major findings regarding the nature of knowledge transfer and their relation to the current themes. A selective review of the literature was carried out in this paper instead of a meta-analysis. The papers were identified through popular databases. The authors also examined the references of selected papers to provide a comprehensive review of the construct. Findings The debate about codification of knowledge that has stimulated the academic community in organizational studies is still in its infancy. The other debates that have been discussed in this paper have either reached their peak or have given way to newer debates. A clear understanding of the significance of the nature of knowledge transfer is very important at this juncture. The model developed toward the end of the paper assumes a path in this direction. The authors also discuss how research on knowledge has both deepened and expanded the authors' understanding of knowledge transfer since March and Simon (1958). Originality/value The debate in the field of organizational studies around the nature of knowledge transfer has been occurring for some time. However, there has not been any final consensus on the nature of knowledge transfer. While looking at these debates with a critical eye, the authors may appear to be cynical about the prospect of an end to these deliberations. The authors conclude the paper with a model that examines knowledge transfer from a broader perspective that encompasses the various theoretical perspectives.

AB This paper investigates the role of public knowledge partnerships in EU-funded framework programmes (FP) on knowledge creation across a sample of European countries. Different from previous studies, we investigate whether the impact of participation in FP on new knowledge (patents) differs across private companies, universities and public research centres. We find that, while all institutional sectors benefit from joint projects, the main benefits (in terms of patenting activity) go to universities and public research centres, while private companies benefit less. We also find evidence of important complementarities between participation in international research projects and internal innovation drivers (researchers), thus highlighting the crucial role of domestic absorptive capacity for fully benefiting from international cooperation in R&D projects.

AB The aim of this article is to analyze the linkages between and spillovers from foreign-owned (foreign) to domestic-owned (domestic) firms in the Czech automotive industry. Theoretically and conceptually, our research draws on two strands of literature: spillovers, linkages and effects of foreign direct investment on domestic firms and regional economic development; and literature on global production networks, global value chains and industrial upgrading. Empirical analysis is based upon unique data collected by the authors through a questionnaire completed by 317 foreign and domestic firms in 2009 and on-site interviews with 100 firms conducted between 2009 and 2011. Data analysis has identified a low share of domestic suppliers in the total supplies of Czech-based foreign firms and diverse spillover effects from foreign to domestic firms. Domestic firms vary in their capabilities and absorptive capacity which, along with the particular nature of the contemporary automotive value chain, significantly influence their ability and potential to benefit from linkages and spillovers.

AB This paper investigates the process of knowledge exchange in inter-firm Research and Development (R&D) alliances by means of an agent-based model. Extant research has pointed out that firms select alliance partners considering both network-related and network-unrelated features (e.g., social capital versus complementary knowledge stocks). In our agent-based model, firms are located in a metric knowledge space. The interaction rules incorporate an exploration phase and a knowledge transfer phase, during which firms search for a new partner and then evaluate whether they can establish an alliance to exchange their knowledge stocks. The model parameters determining the overall system properties are the rate at which alliances form and dissolve and the agents' interaction radius. Next, we define a novel indicator of performance, based on the distance traveled by the firms in the knowledge space. Remarkably, we find that - depending on the alliance formation rate and the interaction radius - firms tend to cluster around one or more attractors in the knowledge space, whose position is an emergent property of the system. And, more importantly, we find that there exists an inverted U-shaped dependence of the network performance on both model parameters.

AB Network ties play an important role in the outside-in strategy for marketing and competitive advantages. However, prior research adopting the outside-in view has not always been clear on the impact of network ties. We propose a contingency view that the mere presence of network ties is not sufficient for performance improvement; rather, network ties need to be combined with resource endowments of the alters and absorptive capacity of the ego. These three components work together and reinforce each other in inducing desirable outcomes. We further apply this contingency view to the adoption of health information technology (HIT) by US hospitals. The results strongly support the contingency view. Our study helps reconcile the conflicting findings on the impact of network ties and contributes to the literature of outside-in strategy and social network.

AB Knowledge has become the key asset for the economy to gain competitiveness as more and more countries have shifted or are shifting towards knowledge-based economy, no exception for Malaysia. In order to acquire and transfer technology and/or knowledge from overseas to Malaysia, Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) has been proposed. However, research focuses on cross-border knowledge transfer especially in the context of MSC status corporations in Malaysia is still limited. The factors that affect the effectiveness of cross-border knowledge transfer will be determined and presented in this paper. Quantitative approach has been adopted in this study. The findings of this study show that knowledge characteristics (KC) and network characteristics (NC) have positive significant relationship with cross-border knowledge transfer. The effects context towards KC and NC will also be examined in this study.

Both our panel and instrumental variable estimations for European regions suggest that network relations are crucial sources of R&D spillovers, but with potentially different features. Both import and co-patenting relations affect local productivity directly, but spillovers from innovation-leading regions are effective only when they are import-mediated and when recipient regions have a solid knowledge base. From a policy perspective, this may frustrate recent European policy initiatives, such as Smart Specialization, which are designed to benefit all regions in Europe.

AB Although research on reverse knowledge transfer (RKT) from subsidiaries to headquarters is increasingly prominent, the debate concerning the primary determinants influencing RKT has not reached an academic consensus. Therefore, we have attempted to draw an overall picture for RKT by using both knowledge transfer capacity and relational capital as overarching theoretical lenses. In a sample of South Korea, we find that knowledge development capability, subsidiary willingness, and autonomy are critical factors affecting the reverse transfer of local market information within MNC networks. Furthermore, both the knowledge integration mechanism and trust are facilitators for improving relational capital between subsidiaries and MNCs. This factor facilitates RKT from the former to the latter. Copyright (c) 2017 ASAC. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This study examines the role of transfer mechanisms, including replication and adaptation, in knowledge transfer from the cooperative competency perspective. This study tests the hypotheses in a sample of 120 knowledge transfer cases. The results indicate that transfer mechanisms relate positively to cooperative competency with partnering firms, which then improves knowledge transfer performance. The results provide evidence that cooperative competency plays a mediating role between transfer mechanisms and knowledge transfer performance. The findings of this study contribute to the theoretical development of a conceptual model for explaining the interrelationships among transfer mechanisms, cooperative competency, and knowledge transfer performance. The empirical evidence of the Sobel test in line with Baron and Kenny's procedure and bootstrap analysis supports the process-oriented view and indicates that cooperative competency mediates the effects of transfer mechanisms on knowledge transfer performance. Finally, this study discusses the managerial implications and highlights future research directions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Effective knowledge transfer can improve the work efficiency of project network members. However, as traditional labor-intensive enterprises, construction companies do not pay enough attention to knowledge management, and the characteristics of projects increase knowledge loss to a certain extent. This results in the knowledge-transfer performance of a project network not being ideal and work efficiency reduction. This paper aims to explore knowledge-transfer factors and their relationships in construction project cooperation networks (CPCNs). A framework model and hypotheses were formulated through literature research, theoretical analysis, and practical experience. The authors applied structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the hypotheses based on a questionnaire survey data set of 210 workers from Chinese construction companies. The results showed that, in the context of Chinese relationships, the temporary nature of projects will not affect knowledge transfer in CPCNs. The urgency of projects will positively affect parts of network members' knowledge transfer. The relationship between knowledge suppliers and recipients plays a critical role in mediating the influences of project characteristics on knowledge-transfer performance.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to adopt the recipient's perspective to explore multi-level antecedents' effects on knowledge transfer using social capital and social network theories.
   Design/methodology/approach - Social network and general attribute survey responses from 331 employees were analyzed through hierarchical linear modeling to verify the study's multi-level research model and hypotheses.
   Findings - A recipient's trust in colleagues positively influences knowledge transfer and company tenure has a negative impact. At a dyadic level, the perceived expertise of a source, in addition to strength of ties, exerts a positive effect on knowledge transfer. Additionally, a recipient's network centrality moderates the effects of dyadic relationships on knowledge transfer.
   Research limitations/implications - This study deepened the current understanding of the role of social capital in knowledge transfer from a recipient's perspective. Three dimensions of a recipient's social capital respectively showed significant, but different types of influence on knowledge transfer. Interaction effects between individual and dyadic level antecedents should be considered as well.
   Practical implications - Both a strong tie at a dyadic level and a diverse network at an individual level should be nurtured to facilitate knowledge transfer. In addition, bi-directional knowledge transfer between seasoned employees and new employees should be promoted.
   Originality/value - Most studies have focused on motivating a knowledge source, assuming that a recipient is always ready to adopt a source's knowledge. To reduce this bias, the current study examined social capital's role in knowledge transfer from a recipient's perspective.

AB Using company-level data for the USA we study the productivity effects of knowledge spillovers, induced by the diffusion of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in the markets where companies operate. We adopt multiple spillover proxies and account for firms' absorptive capacity and lagged effects. Our results show that intra-industry ICT spillovers have a contemporaneous negative effect while the impact of inter-industry spillovers is positive. The overall productivity effect of ICT is negative, except for those companies with a strong absorptive capacity. However, after a 5-year lag the overall spillover effect turns positive while the role of absorptive capacity diminishes as a consequence of decreasing learning costs and more accessible technology.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to employ agility concept to develop a contingency perspective of relationship between suppliers' involvement, absorptive capacity (AC) and product innovation (PI). While the moderating effect of AC on the relationship between supplier involvement and PI performance is investigated, a firm's agility in PI is entered as one dimension of the firm's performance to accommodate a multidimensional perspective.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper formulates six hypotheses extracted from the relevant literature. The survey was conducted over the internet by using web-based questionnaire. A sampling frame of 1,200 manufacturing UK-based companies provided 233 usable responses. A confirmatory factor analysis was used to test a validity and reliability of constructs and further the paper employed hierarchical multiple regression to test the research hypotheses.
   Findings - The results while reaffirm some of the existing theories of the subject provide some differing view of the issues allowing projection of new insight on the approach to PI and involvement of suppliers. The results support the proposition of PI performance multidimensionality where achievements beyond financial and market-related factors play a critical role. Furthermore, research findings suggest AC as a competitive factor that can provide the grounds for proactively winning in the PI game through increasing agility capabilities.
   Research limitations/implications - This study uses a random sample of UK manufacturing companies, which could be extended to firms from outside the UK too.
   Originality/value - The paper provides a new insight into the existing literature on "new product innovation" and its relationship with suppliers' involvement as well as the firm's AC by employing agility perspective, as a leading theory to explain dynamics and uncertainties in the business environment.

AB Purpose This paper aims to explore the effect of subsidiary autonomy on knowledge transfers during captive offshoring to emerging markets.
   Design/methodology/approach Five longitudinal cases of captive R&D and manufacturing offshoring to emerging markets.
   Findings The propositions entail the dual effect of operational subsidiary autonomy on primary knowledge transfer and reverse knowledge transfer. For newly established subsidiaries, operational subsidiary autonomy has a mainly negative effect on primary knowledge transfer and a mainly positive effect on reverse knowledge transfer and local collaboration activities increase this effect. Strategic subsidiary autonomy is mainly negative for primary and reverse knowledge transfer.
   Research limitations/implications Limitations concerning the applied exploratory case study approach suggest that further research should test the identified relationships using surveys, after the initial pilot study.
   Practical implications A gradual increase of operational subsidiary autonomy as the subsidiary capability level increases is beneficial to ensure primary knowledge transfer. Allowing subsidiaries to collaborate locally within the confines of their mandates benefits reverse knowledge transfer.
   Originality/value This paper extends the secondary knowledge transfer concept to include knowledge flows with local collaboration partners, not only other subsidiaries and clarifies the distinction between operational and strategic autonomy concerning local collaboration. A subsidiary asserts operational autonomy when its collaboration with local partners relates to its existing mandate. A subsidiary asserts strategic autonomy when it collaborates with local partners beyond this mandate.

AB In the big data environment, enterprises must constantly assimilate big data knowledge and private knowledge by multiple knowledge transfers to maintain their competitive advantage. The optimal time of knowledge transfer is one of the most important aspects to improve knowledge transfer efficiency. Based on the analysis of the complex characteristics of knowledge transfer in the big data environment, multiple knowledge transfers can be divided into two categories. One is the simultaneous transfer of various types of knowledge, and the other one is multiple knowledge transfers at different time points. Taking into consideration the influential factors, such as the knowledge type, knowledge structure, knowledge absorptive capacity, knowledge update rate, discount rate, market share, profit contributions of each type of knowledge, transfer costs, product life cycle and so on, time optimization models of multiple knowledge transfers in the big data environment are presented by maximizing the total discounted expected profits (DEPs) of an enterprise. Some simulation experiments have been performed to verify the validity of the models, and the models can help enterprises determine the optimal time of multiple knowledge transfer in the big data environment.

AB Despite the diffusion of communication tools and boundary spanning technologies, knowledge flows in innovation processes retain a distinct localized nature in many industries, and geographical clusters emerge as critical areas to foster technological diffusion. In this article, we focus on the knowledge mediating role, as technological "gatekeepers," of focal firms in industrial districts. Based on a longitudinal dataset of 720 patents granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) between 1990 and 2003 to firms in the automatic packaging machinery industrial district in Northern Italy, and controlling for the uneven geographical distribution of patenting activities, we show that: (i) firms within the district use local knowledge to a greater extent and more rapidly than knowledge from outside the district, (ii) focal firms use external knowledge to a greater extent than other firms operating in the district, and (iii) other (nonfocal) firms within the district rely on knowledge generated by focal firms to a greater extent than would be expected, given the geographic distribution of innovative activity in the industry. Implications for research on innovation in localized economic systems and firm-level strategic differentiation are discussed.

AB Efforts to promote and support knowledge-based entrepreneurship as a vehicle for economic development are increasingly focused on the importance of networks to entrepreneurial success. This article reviews the extant empirical literature and finds a striking consensus among multiple disciplinary perspectives: not only are networks important, network characteristics also mediate resources important to entrepreneurial performance. Unfortunately, current conceptual frameworks do not adequately account for the unique nature of knowledge spillovers and their role in innovation and economic dynamism. The article suggests that scholars embrace the nascent knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship to guide future empirical research on entrepreneurship networks and focus intently on their impact on entrepreneurial performance-and therefore economic growth.

AB Adopting a knowledge-based perspective, this study develops a framework of how Italian industrial districts (IDs) operate and evolve as cognitive systems. First, we analyse the mechanisms that facilitate knowledge diffusion across firms within IDs, the enabler of cross-firm knowledge transfer (absorptive capacity) and the process of producing new knowledge by combination. Within this analysis, we consider the formation of new firms resulting from the break-away of human resources from existing district firms (spin-offs) as a particular form of knowledge transfer and production within districts. Knowledge production by combination may take place not only within boundaries of IDs, but also involve external sources. We suggest that innovations made by combining internal and external knowledge have played an important role in shaping the evolutionary trajectories of IDs. Finally, again from the cognitive perspective, we address the issue of how globalization impacts on district systems, concentrating on the positive role that two different types of local actors play in their reproduction and evolution: the global-local firms and institutions providing knowledge-intensive business services.

AB Any collaborative innovation activities can not be separated from the support of social networks. Many factors in the social network affect the knowledge transfer activities. Moreover, the effectiveness of knowledge transfer determines the performance of collaborative innovation. From the point of view of relevance between collaborative innovation behavior and social network, this paper analyzes the influence of some factors in social network on knowledge transfer of school enterprise synergy innovation. The purpose of this paper is to find out the laws of knowledge transfer in the process of University-Industry (U-I) collaborative innovation, and to verify the role of these laws through system dynamics simulation. Firstly, this paper summarizes the previous views on collaborative innovation and U-I knowledge transfer. Based on the analysis of literature, it puts forward the process model of knowledge transfer in U-I Collaborative Innovation and analyzes the factors that affect this process. Secondly, the paper uses a system dynamics method to analyze the causality of knowledge transfer in the process of U-I collaborative innovation, establishes the model of system flow diagrams, and uses Vensim PLE to test the validation and sensitivity of the model. Furthermore, the experimental results demonstrate that the model could fit well the actual knowledge transfer activities in the process of U-I collaborative innovation. And, the results show that some factors in social networks (trust, knowledge transfer capability, knowledge absorptive capacity, and contract mechanisms) affect U-I knowledge transfer in different degrees. Finally, some suggestions concerning the promotion of knowledge transfer are presented according to the simulation.

AB In this era of globalization, firms need to develop dynamic internationalization capability for international competition. Originally, the concept of dynamic internationalization capability is related to a firm's ability to enhance, combine, or reconfigure existing various resource bundles and capabilities in order to address rapidly changing global environments. The networking in international marketing is the dynamic internationalization capability of organizations to realize sustainable competitive advantage. This requires organizations to continuously consolidate foreign relations with partners, suppliers and customers, and also adapt their resources and routines accordingly, for which they are heavily dependent on knowledge. Knowledge Acquisition by networking as an antecedent for dynamic internationalization capability is, however, understudied. This article explores the relationship among international network relationship, absorptive capacity and dynamic internationalization capability, and their impact on the international performance of small and medium-sized enterprises. It also extends the literatures on dynamic internationalization capability by introducing absorptive capacity as a moderator. This study empirically examines the research framework using survey data from 211 manufacturing firms. The findings confirm previous studies that claim a positive relationship among international network relationship, dynamic internationalization capability, and international performance. In addition, the results indicate that absorptive capacity positively moderates the relationship between international network relationship and international exploitation. More importantly, the findings suggest that experts should consider ambidexterity as a competitive contextual factor in line with the complementary effect of international exploration and exploitation. The article concludes with a discussion of implications for research and practice.

AB This study examined whether and how university knowledge affected industrial R&D in the period when university-industry collaborations encountered institutional barriers in Japan. Estimation results of the regional knowledge production function using panel data (1983-1997) revealed that university research in a region positively affected valuable innovations in the region, measured by US patents filed by the Japanese firms, with a five-year lag. University-industry joint research did not act as a conduit of university spillover, which suggested that informal channels, such as voluntary transfer of academic inventions in return to donation, worked in the pre-reform period. Intermediaries as part of regional innovation policy, such as local public technology centres, increased valuable innovations not through intermediation of university-industry joint research, but through technology diffusion, such as technical consultation.

AB Kauffeld-Monz M. and Fritsch M. Who are the knowledge brokers in regional systems of innovation? A multi-actor network analysis, Regional Studies. The discussion on regional innovation systems emphasizes the duality of local and global links. This empirical analysis of eighteen German regional innovation networks shows that public research organizations, especially universities, are profoundly involved in knowledge-exchange processes and possess more central (broker) positions within their regional innovation networks than private firms. This results, in part, from public research's gatekeeper function', which can be particularly important in lagging regions that typically suffer from a lack of large firms that often fill this role in advanced regions. The transferred knowledge is absorbed, especially, by private firms without inter-regional research and development cooperation activity.

AB We study numerically the knowledge innovation and diffusion process on four representative network models, such as regular networks, small-world networks, random networks and scale-free networks. The average knowledge stock level as a function of time is measured and the corresponding growth diffusion time, tau is defined and computed. On the four types of networks, the growth diffusion times all depend linearly oil the network size N as tau similar to N, while the slope for scale-free network is minimal indicating the fastest growth and diffusion of knowledge. The calculated variance and spatial distribution of knowledge stock illustrate that optimal knowledge transfer performance is obtained on scale-free networks. We also investigate the transient pattern of knowledge diffusion on the four networks, and a qualitative explanation of this finding is proposed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this paper is to explore the inter-organisational knowledge networks that universities in the UK engage in through their knowledge transfer activities. In particular, it analyses the extent to which organisational and locational factors are associated with the nature of these networks. Based on a UK-wide survey of universities, it is shown that the nature and formation of inter-organisational knowledge networks is related principally to the organisational characteristics of network actors, and secondarily to their spatial location. The characteristics of a network actor, in this case a university, are likely to influence the type, diversity and location of other actors with which it networks. Nevertheless, spatial location is an important secondary factor influencing network formation, especially the geographic reach of a university's network. It is further found that the value generated by universities from their knowledge networks is associated with the type of organisations within which they interact as well as their spatial location. It is concluded that such networks impact both regional innovation capability and regional competitiveness. The results have implications for policymakers, especially in terms of the spatial scale at which the demand and supply for university knowledge can be best mediated.

AB Most analyses of the relationship between spatial clustering and the technological learning of firms have emphasised the influence of the former on the latter, and have focused on intra-cluster learning as the driver of innovative performance. This paper reverses those perspectives. It examines the influence of individual firms' absorptive capacities on both the functioning of the intra-cluster knowledge system and its interconnection with extra-cluster knowledge. It applies social network analysis to identify different cognitive roles played by cluster firms and the overall structure of the knowledge system of a wine cluster in Chile. The results show that knowledge is not diffused evenly 'in the air', but flows within a core group of firms characterised by advanced absorptive capacities. Firms' different cognitive roles include some-as in the case of technological gatekeepers-that contribute actively to the acquisition, creation and diffusion of knowledge. Others remain cognitively isolated from the cluster, though in some cases strongly linked to extra-cluster knowledge. Possible implications for policy are noted. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB Existing models of the internationalization process have not captured the important phenomenon of accelerated international growth of born-global firms, which led Johanson and Vahlne (2003) to revise their model. However, the revised network model falls short of explaining rapid internationalization of firms. While they indicate a "specific relationship development process" used by born-global managers, Johanson and Vahlne (2003) still Suggest the existence of an incremental learning and "responsive" model, which is based on pre-existing relationships. We extend current theory in arguing that born-global managers can use both pre-existing and newly formed relationships, to quickly and proactively develop new knowledge for rapid commercialization of their products. Proactive, advanced relationship-building capability is based around locating partners with technological knowledge with a view to ensuring ease of sharing knowledge. We explore the development of trust and inter-firm partnerships in established and newly formed networks and how these lead to tacit knowledge, absorptive capacity and new knowledge generation. While Johanson and Vahlne (2003) emphasize "market specific experience and operation experience" we emphasize "technological experience". The reason that knowledge sharing is able to Proceed quickly is that the shared "technological knowledge" allows rapid transfer and development of new knowledge and the drive to commercialize a product before a competitor, promotes the "mutual need" (co-dependency) to act quickly, characteristic of technology-based industries, which face rapid change. As an outcome of the born-global manager's ability to locate new partners through existing networks, new international links may be quickly developed, with internationalization being an outcome, but not necessarily a driver of behaviour ill smaller born-global supply chains.

AB This article describes advances in the study of knowledge transfer in organizations over the fifteen years since Argote and Ingram (2000) appeared in Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes. Argote and Ingram developed mechanisms of knowledge transfer and discussed factors that facilitate or impede transfer. Conditions under which knowledge transfer improves organizational performance were identified and conditions under which knowledge transfer is a source of competitive advantage for organizations were theorized. The current article concludes that research subsequent to the publication of Argote and Ingram has both increased the depth of our understanding of knowledge transfer and broadened the factors considered as predictors and consequences of transfer. Challenges to studying knowledge transfer, primarily in the area of measurement, are described, and new measurement approaches are discussed. We conclude with a discussion of future research directions that are likely to be productive and suggest that expanding the study of knowledge transfer to new problem domains, such as entrepreneurship, would advance knowledge of those domains as well as increase understanding of knowledge transfer.

AB Knowledge transfer provides opportunities for interpersonal cooperation and becomes increasingly important in organizations. Although the benefits of knowledge transfer have been discussed in many settings, the temporal behavior of the knowledge transfer process has not been fully understood. Moreover, we still lack a clear picture of how knowledge transfer performance is jointly influenced by learning and forgetting, which are essential agent behaviors in knowledge transfer. In this paper, we systematically characterize the time scales of the spreading and fixation of knowledge in a networked system through theoretical and numerical analysis. Our knowledge transfer model is based on the Moran process which describes the competition between knowledge learning and forgetting. Besides the knowledge fixation time, we also consider the knowledge spreading time, which measures the time needed for the new knowledge to reach all the agents before fixation. Four distinct phases in the knowledge transfer process are established. The boundary and time scale of each phase is determined theoretically and computationally. Our theory provides a simple and inspiring relationship between time scales, knowledge stock, and system size. As the first systematical investigation on time scales and structure of knowledge fixation process in the organizational knowledge transfer literature, this research highlights the pattern of intra-organizational knowledge transfer and its performance implications, which can be used to understand the relational profiles and learning potential in multi-agent firms.

AB Open innovation ecosystems involve the transfer of knowledge between multiple stakeholders to contribute toward product and service innovation, and to an extent, have superseded network-level approaches to co-creation. Effective management of the knowledge and information transferred between ecosystem partners is crucial for the process of open innovation. However, to date, limited research has focused on ascertaining the conditions required for knowledge transfer success, particularly where the context involves collaboration between diverse organizational actors. Correspondingly, this study extends existing knowledge by presenting an exploration of conditions for knowledge transfer success between ecosystem partners. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with thirty key stakeholders in order to acquire their perceptions of the presence of specific conditions within their ecosystem partnerships. Empirical data were analyzed using a fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis approach, resulting in the production of success recipes from multinational, small and medium-sized enterprise, and academic institution perspectives. Results indicate that combinations of knowledge, relationship, and organizational characteristics contribute to knowledge transfer success. However, these combinations are found to be dependent on the type of ecosystem partnership involved. Theoretical and practical implications of the study are presented, along with acknowledged limitations and suggestions for further work.

AB This paper examines how knowledge properties of a manufacturing activity transfer in international manufacturing network impact performance during the transfer itself and after steady state has been reached. Hierarchical regression was used to test the relationship on survey data from 178 companies. Knowledge properties as a group was significantly affected by both performance measures when controlling for the effects of sender unit experience, sender unit size and receiver unit experience. The activities transferred thus impact the success of the transfer. The control variables of sender unit experience and receiver unit experience have their relatively strongest performance effects after steady state has been reached. Independency was the single knowledge property dimensions with the strongest relative performance effect. This is one of the first survey studies to cover both the performance of the transfer itself and after reaching steady state of manufacturing transfers. Several strands of further research were therefore identified.

AB This conceptual paper contributes to the nascent debate on a stronger appreciation of subsidiaries' contribution to knowledge creation and transfer within the Multinational Corporation (MNC) network reflected by increased levels of reverse and/or horizontal knowledge transfer. Furthermore, the current literature implies scattered evidence with respect to the influential factors and controversial power interests on behalf of the players involved: the MNC headquarter, the individual subsidiaries and between the subsidiaries. For this reason, the paper aims to develop a holistic conceptual framework as a basis for a future research agenda on multidirectional knowledge transfer driven by a concerted effort of all partners involved. Owing to its high cultural density and diversity in a close geographical space, Europe is regarded an ideal and vibrant setting for research on knowledge creation. As a side effect of an increased level of competitiveness, MNCs might play a significant role in contributing to the EU objectives of higher levels of prosperity of an ever more integrated economy and of new energies for the region's technological and industrial development.

AB Science parks are often established to drive regional economic growth, especially in countries with emerging economies. However, mixed findings on the innovation outcomes of science park firms are reported in the literature. This study systematically identifies innovation outputs used in the science park literature and argues: (a) that firms generate different outcomes at various stages of the innovation process; and (b) that their use is a possible explanation for the mixed findings reported in the field. This paper combines a knowledge production function approach, modeling knowledge transfers and spillover flowing to new technology-based firms (NTBFs) in the emerging South African economy with innovation outcomes, which are measured by using a multi-dimensional construct. The estimations produce non-consistent and non-systematic results across different dimensions of innovation outcomes, implying that results are outcome indicator specific and that it makes sense to distinguish multiple indicators of innovation outcomes referring to different phases in a firm's innovation process.

AB Coordinating knowledge transfer within multi-plant manufacturing networks is a challenging task. Using a computational model, we examine when it is beneficial to create production knowledge within a central unit, the lead factory, and transfer it to geographically dispersed plants. We demonstrate that the knowledge transfer generates a trade-off between a positive cost-saving effect due to fewer adaptations in each plant, and a negative transfer cost effect due to the costly knowledge transfer itself. The complexity of the production process moderates the performance implications of the knowledge transfer because it determines the relative strength of these two effects. For production processes with low complexity, knowledge transfer can engender superior network performance. Here, an optimal extent of knowledge transfer exists, and thus, a complete knowledge transfer is not performance maximizing. For production processes with medium and high levels of complexity, performance is reduced rather than enhanced through knowledge transfer so that it is optimal not to transfer any knowledge from the lead factory to the plants. While we analyze knowledge transfer within a manufacturing network, our results are transferable to other settings that consist of a knowledge sending and receiving unit.

AB In this paper we examine the impact of three host country (HC) factors like spillovers from Aerospace R&D, Military R&D and University research on a sample of aerospace firms for knowledge creation and collaboration with local HCs inventors. Data sources include a sample of 874 international plants of aerospace companies, which was split into OEM firms (Original Equipment Manufacturers) and top specialized supplier firms (TIER), and information from the HCs. The results showed the existence of knowledge spillovers from aerospace R&D and research institutions produced in HCs. The OEM group is more efficient than the TIER group in appropriating aerospace R&D. On the contrary, TIER group is more globalized and their knowledge is more based on their own expertise than on in-house R&D. Foreign aerospace firms benefit specially from research institutions' knowledge spillovers produced in related fields to the aerospace industry.

AB Resource-based learning capacity (RBLC) is an organization's specific resources - both human and tangible - that can be organized to enhance learning processes. This study develops and tests a model that examines the relationship between the learning efforts of focal firms from their international business affiliates (IBAs) - organizations located outside the focal firm's domestic market with whom the focal firm has a relationship - and the focal firms' RBLC. This learning process refers to the transfer of knowledge from the IBA to the focal firm. Results indicate that while learning effectiveness positively influences the RBLC of the focal firm, learning efficiency has a negative impact on RBLC. The IBA's home country network centrality and the tie strength between the focal organization and the IBA are found to influence learning effectiveness positively. Tie strength also enhances learning efficiency. Finally, the findings indicate that the IBA's home country network centrality enhances the strength of the ties between the focal organization and its IBA. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Knowledge transfer in an organization is the process through which one unit (e.g., group, department, or division) is affected by the experience of another. Yet, experience has shown that transferring knowledge, whether at the individual, group, product line, department, or division level is usually a laborious, time-consuming, and difficult task. In this article, we review 20 recent empirical studies on knowledge transfer and suggest a four-stage process model to summarize and organize their findings. The resulted in a framework where determinants for success at each stage of the knowledge transfer process are defined. Based on this knowledge transfer framework, we propose a knowledge transfer management system that integrates current knowledge management tools and technologies to support the needs at different stages of the knowledge transfer process.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this study is to deal with the performance consequences of business units that adopt varying knowledge roles within the internal multi-business network. Multi-business firms are distributed knowledge systems in which business units are extensively involved in internal knowledge transfer processes. Business units play different roles within their respective corporate knowledge networks as knowledge providers, knowledge receivers, both or neither.
   Design/methodology/approach - Survey data from a sample of 225 business divisions were analyzed using a multivariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).
   Findings - Results indicate that divisions which occupy knowledge roles that reveal the possession of unique knowledge (knowledge signaling) or guarantee the accumulation of new knowledge (knowledge learning) outperform those divisions that have access to spilled knowledge (knowledge depreciation) or have no access to any kind of knowledge (knowledge insulation).
   Practical implications - Four knowledge roles are distinguished according to the extent to which a business division provides the rest of the corporation with knowledge or receives knowledge from the rest of the corporation, thus exploring the issue of internal knowledge transfer from an integrated perspective that takes the directionality of knowledge flows and the position within the knowledge network into account.
   Originality/value - This study contributes to existent research on knowledge transfer and performance outcomes by demonstrating the usefulness of the knowledge role as an integrating concept within this literature. It also extends the four-role framework to the prescriptive domain and tests its normative implications in an intensive internal knowledge transfer setting which has to date gone relatively unnoticed, as is that of multi-business firms.

AB The complex and unpredictable nature of projects generates serious challenges for managers of projects and project-based organizations. Knowledge represents one of the key project capabilities that enables projects and project-based organizations to cope with these challenges. Knowledge transfer across projects moves knowledge from project sources of knowledge to project recipients with the goal of improving performance and capabilities. The goal of this study is to examine the associations between the level of knowledge transfer across project effort, the body of knowledge of projects obtained from other projects, and the project performance. A Survey of 46 closed projects provided the data to test 3 hypotheses. The results show that the body of knowledge of projects obtained from other projects is positively associated with project performance. Other results demonstrate that the level of knowledge transfer across project effort is associated with an increase in the capabilities and performance of projects. Managers of projects and project-based organizations can use the results of this investigation to further understand the benefits and challenges of knowledge transfer across projects. The results of this investigation can be used for further research and development in the areas of project management, knowledge management, and projects' knowledge systems.

AB Previous research has predominantly conceptualized absorptive capacity as an intraorganizational phenomenon, primarily by means of quantitative methods. In contrast, this research develops a practice-based understanding of how an interorganizational network can engage in network absorptive and desorptive capacity-related (NAC and NDC respectively) activities. SEMiconductor MAnufacturing TECHnologies(SEMATECH) is an interorganizational network to develop innovative semiconductor manufacturing solutions globally. Based upon an in-depth case study of SEMATECH we add to the literature as follows: first, we introduce NAC and NDC, venturing beyond the organization or dyad as the unit of analysis. Second, we adopt a practice perspective in order to illustrate how SEMATECH is able to engage in NAC- and NDC-related activities, primarily by means of three practices, that is, congregating, roadmapping and offering access. These practices re-inform each other, allowing SEMATECH, in effect, to coordinate the network's knowledge-related activities with regard to knowledge outside of the network.

AB This paper reported a practice on innovations attained through knowledge transfer in knowledge communities of a high-tech enterprise. In this case, leaders in advanced semiconductor packaging and testing technologies drove knowledge communities according to the company's core abilities and organization learning strategies. Their remarkable practical knowing could be a paradigm for other high-tech companies. This paper discovered mechanisms of the intra-organizational knowledge networks, and the results showed that, the transfer of management know-how was facilitated by community competition and interaction. The knowledge transfer behavior intention (KTBI) was associated with four factors and it had a significantly positive impact on community members' innovation. This paper provided a theoretical and practical model to support the transfer of knowledge and presented the value and functions of multifaceted innovation communities and organization learning.

AB Purpose This paper aims to offer a comprehensive systematic review of knowledge management (KM) in franchising literature over the past 29 years.
   Design/methodology/approach By means of bibliometric citation analysis, ISI Web of Science (WoS) database is used to analyze articles from 1990-2018. A total of 169 articles by 369 authors across 40 countries published in 113 journals from 200 institutions were clustered and examined through HistCites and VOSviewer.
   Findings The exploration of KM in franchising is associated with 3 factors: governance structure; performance outcome; and franchise network growth. The findings also reveal that KM in franchising is still an emerging discipline encompassing conflicting results which offer potential for future research.
   Research limitations/implications Identified research gaps and contradicting views in the literature offer opportunities for researchers to contribute to this research domain by empirically testing the role of absorptive capacity, replication vs adaptation strategies and new franchising formats, such as micro/social franchising.
   Originality/value This study is unique in its examination of KM in franchising. It also highlights the value of knowledge in franchise chain performance.

AB Using the knowledge-based view of the firm as our theoretical underpinning, we study partnerships between industrial firms and university research centers (URCs) in order to identify facilitators of knowledge transfer, particularly focusing on how firms learn from URCs. Data for this study were obtained from senior-level executives from a random sample of one hundred and seventy-three firms located in the northeastern US. Results indicate that social connectedness, trust, URC technology transfer-intellectual property policies, technological relatedness and technological capability are significant facilitators of knowledge transfer. We also found that the type of knowledge transferred, i.e., explicit versus tacit, moderated these relationships. We conclude with implications for future research and R&D policy.

AB Efficient transfer of knowledge is the prerequisite for innovation and competitiveness of tourism destinations. This paper uses network analysis to examine inter-organizational knowledge transfer in Western Australian tourism. The findings indicate that Western Australian network has low connectivity and is highly centralized around public bodies with a hierarchical pattern. The network also exhibits few reciprocal relationships with limited boundary spanners. The findings improve the understanding of the Western Australian tourism knowledge network, its weaknesses and strengths, which can be used to make policies to have a more efficient and innovative destination. In addition, this research provides a model for future research of how to explore and analyze the inter-organizational transfer of knowledge within a tourism destination.

AB The effective management of knowledge exchange is critical for open innovation in ecosystem contexts where organizations may partner with potential competitors. This study contributes to existing knowledge by detecting the conditions for knowledge transfer success between both coopetitive and non-competitive ecosystem partners. The study uses a qualitative approach. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 stakeholders across multi-industry ecosystems to compare the presence of knowledge transfer conditions between competitors and non-competitors. Through fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), configurational recipes of conditions were identified, revealing the distinct configurations required of either coopetitive or non-competitive partnerships in the context of innovation ecosystems. The findings show the need for organizations to tailor knowledge exchange practices to the competitive nature of each relationship. Notable theoretical and practical implications are provided for ecosystem stakeholders that engage in coopetitive partnerships to develop innovations.

AB Using structural equation modelling on 291 small and medium enterprises in Australia, we examine the impact of knowledge transfers from supply chain actors on innovation and firm performance and how knowledge quality influences these relationships. We find that knowledge transfers from customers and suppliers are positively related to innovativeness, which has a significant influence on firm performance. The results also show that knowledge transfers from suppliers (only) influence knowledge quality, and knowledge transfer from suppliers, in turn, has an indirect effect on innovation through knowledge quality. Thus, the results underscore the importance of knowledge transfers from suppliers to knowledge quality and knowledge transfers from suppliers through knowledge quality for achieving innovation. The results also underline the need to distinguish knowledge transfers from specific actors, in order to understand the influence of knowledge quality on external knowledge transfers and innovation, adding to research into the conditions under which external knowledge transfers contribute to innovation and firm performance.

AB Purpose - This paper aims to address the gap that, to date, no systematic review has been carried out on the role that structural social capital (SC) plays for knowledge transfer and innovation at the interpersonal, inter-unit and inter-firm levels. Individuals and organisations are becoming increasingly involved in collaboration networks to share knowledge and generate innovation. SC theory has been adopted in several areas of study to explain how individuals, groups and organisations manage relationships to generate innovation.
   Design/methodology/approach - This review covers studies of SC in organisational behaviour, strategy and management over a period of 20 years.
   Findings - The literature review shows that knowledge types and knowledge transfer processes are the missing links in the relationship between structural SC and innovation. Moreover, the paper demonstrates that seemingly opposite configurations of SC are complementary to each other (structural holes vs dense networks; strong vs weak ties) and that contextual factors should be considered when discussing the effects of SC on knowledge transfer and innovation. In addition, it is the balance of different configurations of SC which enables an individual or a company to explore, access, assimilate and combine different knowledge types, which will lead to improved innovation outcomes.
   Originality/value - This review facilitates understanding of the role of SC for knowledge transfer processes and the mediating role of knowledge transfer processes and knowledge types in the relationship between structural SC and innovation.

AB This paper reviews current research on knowledge management and knowledge transfer in the context of innovations. Specific attention is focussed on the integration of management perspectives into tourism research. The paper explores some of the key mechanisms and conduits of knowledge transfer within tourism. In doing so it explores such concepts as interlocking directorships, communities of practice, learning regions and labour mobility. There is also an emerging research agenda on knowledge management within tourism but progress is variable with most research being within the hotel sector, where a range of recent studies have examined aspects of knowledge transfer. The paper also draws attention to the need to give closer attention to the nature of innovations within tourism and to consider these in a knowledge management framework. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The paper is concerned with spatial clustering of economic activity and its relation to the spatiality of knowledge creation in interactive learning processes. It questions the view that tacit knowledge transfer is confined to local milieus whereas codified knowledge may roam the globe almost frictionlessly The paper highlights the conditions under which both tacit and codified knowledge can be exchanged locally and globally. A distinction is made between, on the one hand, the learning processes taking place among actors embedded in a community by just being there-dubbed buzz-and, on the other, the knowledge attained by investing in building channels of communication-called pipelines-to selected providers located outside the local milieu. It is argued that the co-existence of high levels of buzz and many pipelines may provide firms located in outward-looking and lively clusters with a string of particular advantages not available to outsiders. Finally, some policy implications, stemming from this argument, are identified.

AB This paper investigates the effects of absorptive capability on the relationship between different external networks and independent innovation in China, and explores their underlying mechanisms. It adopts four types of external networks local business network, local institute network, horizontal spillover network, and vertical spillover network, which were treated as independent variables. Furthermore, the absorptive capability is analyzed as a mediator and moderator variable, and innovation performance is treated as a dependent variable. The findings reinforce that there is a mediating and moderating effect of absorptive capability on the relationship between external networks (local business network and horizontal spillover network) and independent innovation performance.

AB Purpose The paper aims to incorporate the social identity theory perspectives to the knowledge-based view in order to suggest how certain organizational characteristics can be leveraged as knowledge governance mechanisms for interpersonal knowledge transfer within the multinational enterprise (MNE). Design/methodology/approach This paper is a conceptual discussion on interpersonal knowledge governance mechanisms. Findings The paper proposes a new set of governance mechanisms which may be leveraged to govern interpersonal knowledge transfer. These mechanisms utilize organizational identity of individuals to govern individual level knowledge transfer behavior with the MNE. The paper also illustrates how subsidiary power, one of such mechanisms, influences interpersonal knowledge transfer within the MNE through organizational identification. Research limitations/implications As the paper is conceptual, the proposed mechanisms have not been substantiated empirically. It calls for empirically testing the suggested mechanisms across countries. Practical implications The paper provides insights to managers for leveraging on organizational identity to manage interpersonal level knowledge transfer within the MNE. Originality/value The paper adds organizational identity-based knowledge governance mechanisms to the knowledge governance approach. It highlights how certain organizational characteristics (e.g. subsidiary power), even though these are not knowledge governance mechanisms per se, can be utilized to govern interpersonal knowledge transfer with the MNE.

AB Many studies showthat the acquisition of knowledge is the key to building the competitive advantage of companies. We propose a simple model of knowledge transfer within the organisation and we implement the proposed model using the cellular automata technique. In this paper the organisation is considered in the context of complex systems whereby the main role in the organisation is played by the network of informal contacts (informal communication). The goal of this paper is to ascertain which factors influence the efficiency and effectiveness of knowledge transfer. Our studies indicate a significant role of initial distribution of chunks of knowledge for the knowledge transfer process, and the results suggest taking action in the organisation to shorten the distance (social distance) between people with different levels of knowledge, or determining incentives to share knowledge.

This paper examines the influence of open-innovation strategies and knowledge spillovers on innovative performance on a large sample of Spanish manufacturing firms during 1998-2013. Although most open-innovation strategies positively influence innovation, some differences are found depending on the search innovative strategy: technological collaboration with universities, providers, and external research and development (R&D) advice have a positive effect, while collaborations with customers and competitors are not significant. Finally, the paper confirms the positive effects of involuntary knowledge spillovers only for product innovation and of R&D neighbours in the same sector; and the negative effect of R&D neighbours in other sectors.

Die meisten Strategien fur offene Innovation wirken sich positiv auf die Innovation aus, doch je nach der innovativen Suchstrategie finden sich einige Unterschiede: die technische Zusammenarbeit mit Hochschulen, Anbietern und externen Beratern fur Forschung und Entwicklung (F&E) wirkt sich positiv aus, doch die Zusammenarbeit mit Kunden und Konkurrenten ist nicht signifikant. Ebenso werden eine positive Auswirkung von unbeabsichtigten Wissensubertragungen - allerdings nur im Bereich der Produktinnovation -, eine positive Auswirkung von F&E-Nachbarn im selben Sektor und eine negative Auswirkung von F&E-Nachbarn in anderen Sektoren festgestellt.

En este articulo analizamos la influencia de las estrategias de innovacion abierta y la difusion de conocimiento en el desempeno de innovacion en una amplia muestra de empresas manufactureras espanolas entre 1998 y 2013.
   Aunque la mayoria de estrategias de innovacion abierta influyen positivamente en la innovacion, se observan algunas diferencias en funcion de la estrategia de innovacion buscada: la colaboracion tecnologica con universidades, proveedores y el asesoramiento externo de investigacion y desarrollo (I+D) tienen un efecto positivo mientras que las colaboraciones con clientes y competidores no son significativos. Para terminar, se confirman un efecto positivo de la difusion de conocimiento involuntaria solamente para la innovacion de productos, un efecto positivo de vecinos de I+D en el mismo sector y un efecto negativo de vecinos de I+D en otros sectores.

AB There is an extensive literature that examines the relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI) and the productivity and competitiveness of domestic firms. Using estimation techniques from the productivity spillover literature, this paper tests for the presence of environmental spillovers from foreign firms. On the basis that foreign-owned firms may encourage firms in their extended supply chain to improve their environment-related management practices, evidence for the existence of environmental spillovers should be easier to find than productivity spillovers where firms naturally attempt to minimise intra-industry knowledge leakage. In this paper we show that, first, foreign-owned firms are more likely to implement environmental management systems (EMS) and, second, that the presence of foreign-owned firms in those sectors that a firm supplies can encourage good environmental practice. This is especially true if a firm is foreign, has high absorptive capacity, and operates in the presence of formal and informal networks.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to review the literature on knowledge transfer in interorganizational partnerships. The aim is to assess the advances in this field by addressing the questions: What factors impact knowledge transfer in interorganizational partnerships? How do these factors interact with each other? Design/methodology/approach The study reports results of a literature review conducted in ten top journals between 2000 and 2017 in the fields of strategy and innovation studies. Findings The review identifies three overarching themes, which were organized according to 14 research questions. The first theme discusses knowledge in itself and elaborates on aspects of its attributes. The second theme presents the factors that influence interorganizational knowledge transfer at the macroeconomic, interorganizational, organizational and individual levels. The third theme focuses on the consequences, namely, effectiveness and organizational performance.

AB Purpose This paper aims to investigate the relationship between the level of subsidiaries' internal and external relational embeddedness and the degree of subsidiaries' knowledge transfer. More specifically, the aim is to explore dual embeddedness of subsidiaries involved in the knowledge transfer process within multinational corporations' (MNCs) network.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors empirically analyse 165 European subsidiaries to demonstrate the crucial role of dual relational embeddedness in the transfer of knowledge within MNCs. Data were collected via a close-ended questionnaire and processed through an ordinary least squares regression model.
   Findings Results show that internal embeddedness directly and positively influences the degree of subsidiaries' knowledge transfer, whereas external embeddedness does not. Notwithstanding, a higher level of both types of embeddedness - known as dual embeddedness - generates multiplicative and positive effects on the degree of subsidiaries' knowledge transfer.
   Practical implications Best practices and relevant knowledge follow a reverse transfer of knowledge from the subsidiaries to the internal MNC network that is facilitated by the relational embeddedness of subsidiaries. This has resulted in developing a dual embeddedness, which introduces new routines and scripts, as well as more relational links.
   Originality/value The research emphasises the relevance of the knowledge transfer process in multiple directions, evoking the central role of dual-embedded subsidiaries.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between corporate venture capital (CVC) investment and the level of knowledge transferred from start-ups to corporate investors. It also delineates the conditions under which CVC investment facilitates the knowledge transfer.
   Design/methodology/approach - A longitudinal design is used to examine annual snapshots of CVC investment and patent citing activities for the period from 1995 to 2005. This paper uses a negative binomial Poisson regression model to test proposed research hypotheses.
   Findings - The authors found that that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between the number of CVC investments and the level of knowledge transferred from the start-up. The results of this study also found that knowledge diversity of the investing firm moderates the inverted U-shaped relationship.
   Originality/value - This research contributes to the search literature by conceptualizing CVC investment as a distant search process for sourcing external knowledge from start-ups. By arguing theoretically and demonstrating empirically the effects of tie strength of CVC structure and technological knowledge diversity on organizational knowledge transfer, this current study extends the previous understanding and applicability of social relations and technological diversity to understand CVC activity.

AB Rather than looking at the more typical inter-company level adopted in most B2B marketing, this study investigates how a subsidiary gains power within the context of the multinational corporation. Building on network theory and dependence theory, two approaches well-known in the B2B marketing literature, this study aims to test empirically the impact of reverse knowledge transfer, knowledge transfer from a subsidiary to headquarters, on subsidiary influence and autonomy. The survey-based data from 183 subsidiaries located in the UK suggests that reverse knowledge transfer significantly enhances the relative influence of the subsidiary within the broader multinational corporation. Moreover, we find that this association is (a) stronger when the level of internal embeddedness is high and (b) weaker when the level of external embeddedness is high. Finally, our results indicate that a higher level of subsidiary autonomy only occurs in conjunction with internally embedded reverse knowledge transfer. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Building on International Business research on subsidiary activities, this paper investigates the relationship between the type of innovation-intensive activities in an MNE subsidiary and FDI spillovers. Our results show that competence-creating activities by MNE subsidiaries generate significantly different horizontal and vertical spillovers compared with competence-exploiting activities. The findings suggest that FDI spillovers are influenced by the dynamic development of technological and strategic roles in a subsidiary in the dispersed innovation network of an MNE.

AB The literature on knowledge transfer has long recognized the importance of social relations as a conduit of knowledge transfer Two distinct features of social relations have been examined extensively: their strength and structure, Their effects on knowledge transfer remain unclear. however, and researchers have attended to one or the other of two constraints - information loss and transfer cost - in efforts to elucidate them. Yet, few studies analyse the joint effects of these constraints on knowledge transfer in a network directly To examine their interaction, this article develops an agent-based simulation and experiment with four different kinds of relations: a sparse network with weak ties, a sparse network with strong ties, a dense network with weak ties and a dense network with strong ties, At the individual level, the study finds that dense networks comprised of weak ties afford more valuable knowledge if information loss is trivial and the cost of initiating ties is larger than the cost of transfer, but that the value of density declines rapidly as information loss increases. At the organizational level, in contrast, sparse networks with strong ties appear optimal for knowledge transfer via social relations.

AB Most studies on absorptive capacity (AC) are based on assumptions that are characteristic of viewing knowledge from an epistemology of possession (knowledge is possessed by individuals and is transferrable). However, the literature on managing knowledge (or better knowledge work) acknowledges also an epistemology of practice (knowledge is unpredictable and dynamic and constituted in and through practice). Moreover, the literature on AC is relatively silent on the relationship between knowledge and power. In this paper, the authors argue that the AC construct should be interpreted in light of the possession and the practice perspectives of knowledge and power. The analysis includes a systematic literature review of AC that supports the authors' claims and, based on this, they suggest an interpretation of the construct that takes into account knowledge-power relationships. This review and theorizing contribute to a richer and processual view of AC.

AB There is evidence about the international competitiveness of Small and Medium Enterprises having a close relationship with their absorptive capacity and internationalization networking, and for that reason, it is relevant to find out the main trends in this field of knowledge. The objective of this study is to provide a bibliometric analysis of the status of the existing research in the field to recognize main topics and help identify research gaps. This study was done through a review of 1,710 documents published about this relationship from the Scopus and Web of Science databases (1994-2018), using as processing software application that employs two combinations of terms associated with Boolean operators. This was taken into account in order to optimize the accuracy of the search and to facilitate large data capture. The results show that these studies are in a period of high production and concentrated in a few countries and researchers' networks in the United States, the People's Republic of China, and some European countries. Moreover, the trend words used by researchers are those which link absorptive capacity with networking, open innovation, and firm performance.

AB This paper investigates the factors driving nanotechnology development in Chinese regions. Advanced regions of China have spearheaded the country's rapid growth in nanotechnology, aided by substantial support from the government. While this head start could potentially perpetuate regional inequalities through agglomeration economies, the results suggest that knowledge spillovers exert a substantially greater impact in peripheral regions compared with the advanced ones, and may thus be compensating for the limited institutional support they receive and their weak technological capabilities. This research contributes to the regional innovation literature by highlighting that a formal scientific network can counteract the forces of agglomeration economies and spur innovation in peripheral regions.

AB This research considers how different features of informal networks affect knowledge transfer. As a complement to previous research that has emphasized the dyadic tie strength component of informal networks, we focus on how network structure influences the knowledge transfer process. We propose that social cohesion around a relationship affects the willingness and motivation of individuals to invest time, energy, and effort in sharing knowledge with others. We further argue that the network range, ties to different knowledge pools, increases a person's ability to convey complex ideas to heterogeneous audiences. We also examine explanations for knowledge transfer based on absorptive capacity, which emphasizes the role of common knowledge, and relational embeddedness, which stresses the importance of tie strength. We investigate the network effect on knowledge transfer using data from a contract R&D firm. The results indicate that both social cohesion and network range ease knowledge transfer, over and above the effect for the strength of the tie between two people. We discuss the implications of these findings for research on effective knowledge transfer, social capital, and information diffusion.

AB Most catch up studies focus on "external" foreign sources of technological learning as a means of building up latecomer technological capability. By contrast, strategic management studies in advanced countries center on the "internal" sources of organizational learning and routines (including R&D) within a firm, aimed at developing and renewing its knowledge and its absorptive capacity. This paper draws from both groups of studies to examine how latecomer firms accumulate in-house knowledge bases and assimilate foreign knowledge to create strategic innovation capabilities. We propose a clear three-stage development framework to examine two leading firms, AU Optronics (AUO) and Chimei Innolux (CMI), in Taiwan's flat panel display industry. This paper shows the coevolution of the firms' knowledge bases and external foreign sources of knowledge over time. We find that, with their increasing knowledge bases and strategic advancement over time, the firms are able to benefit from knowledge transfer; to build up their high-level innovative capabilities, and in the process to move from junior to senior status with foreign firms. These developments appear to allow leading firms to move "across" the technological frontier, contributing to a strengthening competitive position in the international market.

AB Knowledge transfer between science and technology has been studied at micro- and macro-levels of analysis. This has contributed to the understanding of the mechanisms and drivers, but actual transfer mechanism and process, be they through codified or tacit sources, have very rarely been mapped and measured to completeness and remain, to a large extent, a black box. We develop a novel method for mapping science-technology flows and introduce 'concept clusters' as an instrument to do so. Using patent and publication data, we quantitatively and visually demonstrate the flows of knowledge between academia and industry. We examine the roles of exogenous and endogenous knowledge sources, and of co-inventors and co-authors in the application of university-generated knowledge. When applied to a stylised case, we show that the method is able to trace the linkages between base knowledge and skill sets and their application to a technology, which in some instances span over twenty-five years.

AB In this conceptual paper, we develop a framework which identifies those elements of firms' knowledge context which are important for innovation, and the mechanisms through which that knowledge impacts on firms' innovation performance. We make four main contributions to the existing literature. First, our characterisation of knowledge context provides the basis for a more specific identification of which elements of firms' knowledge environment are important for innovation, discriminating between spatial, sectoral and network influences. Second, we reflect the role of innovation ambition in shaping firms' knowledge search strategies. Third, we differentiate between firms' interactive and non-interactive knowledge search activities and recognise that these may be complemented by unanticipated and serendipitous knowledge spillovers. Finally, we employ the notion of encoding capacity to reflect firms' internal ability to assimilate and apply external knowledge, and clarify its distinctiveness from the more general concept of absorptive capacity. Our framework provides an integrating mechanism for existing empirical studies, and suggests a number of new research directions related to the determinants of innovation performance and the heterogeneity of innovation outcomes.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a critical review of the current body of research on inter-organizational knowledge transfer, indicating some of its limitations and openings for future studies. It maps research in an integrative framework of knowledge-specific, organizational and network-level antecedents and performance outcomes of transfer. When assuming that transfer of knowledge does not by itself influence organizational performance, this study gives special attention to a mediating role of knowledge acquisition in relationship between antecedents and performance outcomes of transfer.
   Design/methodology/approach - In this conceptual paper the author consolidates, annotates and critiques existing research on antecedents and consequences of inter-firm knowledge transfer. The author reveals limitations of the current body of literature and provides directions for future research.
   Findings - This paper points to the underestimated role of knowledge acquisition in conceptual models of inter-firm knowledge transfer. The author suggests that the extent, type and nature of "new knowledge learned" mediate the relationship between various antecedents of transfer and financial, product/market and strategic performance of firms. Related to this, the study calls future research to analyze knowledge transfer as a two-stage process that involves acquisition of knowledge and its exploitation.
   Originality/value - Although research on inter-organizational knowledge transfer is burgeoning, yet our understanding of its antecedents and consequences remains unclear. As a first step to filling this gap, this study provides a comprehensive literature review, reveals its limitations and suggests meaningful directions for further research. It points to high explanatory value of theoretical frameworks that examine linkages between antecedents of transfer, learning outcomes and firm performance results.

AB Policy-makers charged with enhancing the competitiveness of tourism, sometimes draw attention to the potential contribution of universities to strengthening innovative behaviour in the private sector. Business elites (very senior managers of large enterprises) play a key role in determining the propensity of organisations to participate in knowledge transfer with higher education institutions. This paper examines the process of knowledge acquisition among ten British business elites, who between them employ tens of thousands of workers, and the (potential) contribution of universities to that activity. Qualitative data are interpreted using concepts from the literature on knowledge transfer and Mezirow's theory of adult learning. The findings suggest that business elites not only operate within communities of practice but also tend to learn within their own 'meaning perspectives'. As a result, initiatives aimed at strengthening engagement are not likely to succeed unless they are able to influence how elites approach their own learning. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB University-industry partnerships emphasise the transformation of knowledge into products and processes which can be commercially exploited. This paper presents a framework for understanding how social capital in university-industry partnerships affect knowledge transfer strategies, which impacts on collaborative innovation developments. University-industry partnerships in three different countries, all from regions at varying stages of development, are compared using the proposed framework. These include a developed region (Canada), a transition region (Malta), and a developing region (South Africa). Structural, relational and cognitive social capital dimensions are mapped against the knowledge transfer strategy that the university-industry partnership employed: leveraging existing knowledge or appropriating new knowledge. Exploring the comparative presence of social capital in knowledge transfer strategies assists in better understanding how university-industry partnerships can position themselves to facilitate innovation. The paper proposes a link between social capital and knowledge transfer strategy by illustrating how it impacts the competitive positioning of the university-industry partners involved.

AB Organizational networks allow the creation and development of knowledge that can be transferred and shared among their components, with an impact on organizations' innovation and performance. Based on this perspective, this study is the result of research on scientific production related to knowledge transfer in the context of inter-organizational networks. Combining various bibliometric techniques, such as co-occurrence analysis, bibliographic coupling and co-citation of documents and authors, 102 articles on the topic published in the main database of scientific knowledge worldwide, Web of Science, were analyzed in detail. The results indicate that knowledge transfer, in the context of organizations, is a recent topic but one that is clearly expanding. Therefore, this subject has increasingly attracted the attention of researchers all over the world. This study also identifies the origins of the current literature on the subject, as well as its foundations and main intellectual structures. The analysis made also presents information that can serve as a basis for future investigators to project, aim for, and attain better results from their research efforts.

AB Scholars underline the high relevance of bridging organisations in favouring innovation. Nevertheless, they do not investigate enough how bridging organisations favour technology transfer, particularly with regard to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). To fill this research gap, this paper reviews the studies on the technology transfer activities a bridging organisation could perform. Then, the main activities carried out by intermediators are empirically investigated to identify the main intervention processes and activities. The further analysis of these activities identifies three SMEs' abilities an intermediator may promote (i.e. networking, integration and absorptive capacity). This paper offers practical and theoretical contributions. First, it supports the definition of the intermediators' intervention plans with a whole description of the three potential levels of intervention. Second, it synthetises the relationship between technology management, bridging organisations and SMEs in three propositions. Finally, it highlights the need for policy makers' intervention supporting technology transfer offices and local institutions.

AB This paper aims to estimate the impact of collaboration in innovation activities with partners in different geographical areas on innovative performance. By using the Spanish Technological Innovation Panel, this study provides evidence that the benefits of collaboration differ across different dimensions of the geography. We find that the impact of extra-European cooperation on innovation performance is larger than that of national and European cooperation, indicating that firms tend to benefit more from interaction with international collaborators as a way to access new technologies or specialized and novel knowledge that they are unable to find locally. We also find evidence of the positive role played by absorptive capacity, concluding that it implies a higher premium on the innovation returns to cooperation in the international case and mainly in the European one.

AB Consistent with the knowledge-based view of the firm, capability augmentation in the multinational corporation (MNC) entails the adaptation and diffusion of knowledge within a network of globally dispersed subsidiaries. We used case study methodology to examine the transfer of knowledge practices within four MNCs in order to identify specific mechanisms through which social context impacts efficiency and effectiveness of transfer, as well as the resulting development of associated capabilities. The primary findings of this study are the identification of mechanisms that headquarters can use to create mutual inter-dependencies among subsidiaries, which in turn hasten capability development and enhance knowledge flow; and the mutually constructive roles of knowledge transfer and shared context, through promotion of organizational knowledge use. The manner in which these coordination and control mechanisms are implemented facilitates the integration of different units within the networked MNC.

AB Research Summary: We combine the absorptive capacity and social network theory approaches to predict how intrafirm "whole" network characteristics affect the firm's speed of absorption of external knowledge to produce inventions. We start from the widely accepted view that distant, externally-developed knowledge is difficult to absorb into the focal firm's own knowledge production. We suggest that high levels of intrafirm inventor task network diversity and task network density are essential for a diversity of knowledge inputs and coordinated actions regarding knowledge transfer, which in turn, reduces problems related to the absorption of knowledgeespecially in the case of knowledge that is distant from the focal firm. The results of an event history study of 113 pharmaceutical firms that engaged in technology in-licensing from 1986 to 2003 provide general support for our hypotheses.
   Managerial Summary: Firms keen to keep up with an uncertain and ever-changing industry environment, can benefit from the speedy introduction of inventions. We examine how firms absorb licensed-in technologies to nurture the rapid development of own related inventions. We show that a firm's absorption speed depends on the characteristics of the internal collaboration networks among the firm's inventor employees. More specifically, technologically diverse and well-connected inventor networks improve the firm's ability to absorb external technologies quickly. This applies especially to externally acquired technologies that are unfamiliar to the firm. Depending on the distance of the acquired technology from the focal firm combined with speed-inducing inventor network characteristics, our estimates suggest that firms can reduce the time needed for absorption by several months.

AB Within MNCs, the traditional role of headquarters as prime source of knowledge and competencies is changing. Increasingly, headquarters act as a receiver of knowledge from their internationally dispersed subsidiaries. But what drives the benefits headquarters can gain from such reverse knowledge transfers? Drawing on an empirical sample of 294 intra-MNC knowledge transfers, we identify the key variables impacting on headquarters' ability to benefit from reverse knowledge transfer. Taken collectively, our findings indicate that the efficiency of the MNC as a knowledge integrating institution is being driven by changes in both, the subsidiary's context and its capabilities to process knowledge. We discuss the implications of our analysis on the emerging knowledge based theory of the firm, draw out inferences for the strategic agenda of MNCs and suggest avenues for future research.

AB In this study we examine governance factors affecting knowledge transfer in interorganisational development projects. There is a gap in the literature indicating a need for more insights into processes of knowledge sharing and governance of interorganisational development projects. By using cases from the Dutch construction industry, we discus how interorganisational development projects are governed and what impact this has on knowledge transfer between the firms involved. We find that knowledge transfer towards participating firms cooperating in an interorganisational development project is positively influenced when partners govern their cooperation by using mutual trust and contract complementary.

AB The general aim of this paper is to show the results of a study in which we combined bibliometric mapping and citation network analysis to investigate the process of creation and transfer of knowledge through scientific publications. The novelty of this approach is the combination of both methods. In this case we analyzed the citations to a very influential paper published in 1990 that contains, for the first time, the term Absorptive Capacity. A bibliometric map identified the terms and the theories associated with the term while two techniques from the citation network analysis recognized the main papers during 15 years. As a result we identified the articles that influenced the research for some time and linked them into a research tradition that can be considered the backbone of the "Absorptive Capacity Field".

AB Innovation adoptions in agriculture sustain high total factor productivity (TFP) growth and overcome a potential production gap, which is beneficial for food security. Research and development (R&D) innovation adoption in agriculture sector is dependent on producers' willingness to adopt, knowledge capital spillovers, and financial capacity. This research aims to investigate the impact of R&D innovation adoption and climate factors on agriculture TFP growth in Pakistan. The annual time series data were collected from different sources for the period of 1972-2020. For measuring the agriculture TFP, this study adopted the Cobb Douglas and Translog production functions. To analyze the impact of R&D innovation adoption and climate change on agricultural productivity, the dynamic autoregressive distributive lag (ARDL) and two-stage least square (TSLS) approaches were applied for regression analysis. The study outcomes highlight that the agricultural innovation adoption has a significantly positive impact on agriculture TFP growth in Pakistan with weak farmers' absorptive ability. According to the results, agriculture tractors, innovative seed distribution, and fertilizer consumptions make a significantly positive contribution to agriculture TFP growth. Further, rainfall shows a positive and significant impact on agricultural productivity, where a moderate climate is beneficial for agricultural productivity. The estimation results contain policy suggestions for sustainable R&D adoption and agrarians' absorptive ability. Based on the obtained results, it has been suggested that producers should focus on R&D innovation adoption to attain higher productivity. The government needs to emphasize innovative technology adoption, specifically to implement the extension services to increase farmers' education, skills based training, and networking among the farmers to enhance their knowledge capital and absorptive ability. The farmers should also focus on the adoption of climate smart agriculture that can be achieved through the proper utilization of rainwater. For this purpose, the government needs to develop small community dams and large-scale dams for better use of rainwater harvesting.

AB The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between social capital and firm innovation as well as the moderating effects of absorptive capability. In general, network-level technological diversity is utilized to measure a firm's social capital and in this case, an empirical investigation of 748 high-tech firms in Taiwan indicates that such diversity in a firm's social network has an inverted U-shaped relationship with the firms' innovation performance. In addition, we find that by increasing absorptive capability, it will systematically increase the slope and amplitude of the positive effects of diversity as well as maximize the overall value of network-level technological diversity for firm innovation performance. These results also suggest that an overabundance of network-level technological diversity can have a negative impact on firm innovation while a moderate level of such diversity can lead to high levels of innovation performance.

AB Although many studies employ social network theory to explain firm innovation, how individual-level factors lead to a firm's collective innovation capability remains under-researched. Building on studies that use the work boundary to define formal and informal social interactions, this research aims to illuminate how informal buyer-supplier employee interactions influence buyer firms' innovation capabilities through knowledge acquisition. Integrating the literatures on absorptive capacity and social interaction, the analysis of survey data from 273 Chinese manufacturing firms suggests that employees' informal interactions are positively associated with knowledge acquisition and enhance firms' innovation capabilities. Furthermore, the indirect effects of informal interactions on innovation capability are moderated by knowledge application. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose Although there have been a considerable number of studies regarding subsidiary role typology in multinationals' management literature, there appear to be few studies that consider knowledge-based role typology from the network-based perspective. The purpose of this study is to fill this gap and extend the study of Gupta and Govindarajan (1991). Thus, the study focuses on answering the following research question: Do subsidiaries have different roles in terms of knowledge flows within a multinational company (MNC)? Design/methodology/approach This empirical study has been carried out as an explorative single case study. An MNC with 15 foreign subsidiaries headquartered in Turkey, which operated in the manufacturing of household appliances and consumer electronics, has been selected as the case. Knowledge transfer is analyzed in this MNC from the network perspective. Findings Four role typologies are detected for subsidiaries of the MNC: collector transmitter, collector diffuser, converter transmitter and converter diffuser. Research limitations/implications - Findings of this study are specific to this case. Testing the findings in a sample consisting of subsidiaries of MNCs producing transnational products may contribute to the generalizability of these roles. Practical implications - This study offers potentially important findings for MNC managers to use. First, in this study, knowledge flows' route could be defined within MNCs' dual network. Second, role typologies could inform MNC managers to design their MNCs' knowledge network. Originality/value The suggested typologies are expected to more accurately define the roles of subsidiaries within contemporary MNCs which are accepted to be transformed from hierarchical structures to network-based organizations.

AB Purpose This study examines the impact of network embeddedness (NE) on innovation performance in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and analyses absorptive capacity as mediator and openness as moderator. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 209 employees of SMEs using a convenient sampling technique. Partial least squares structural equation modeling in SmartPLS was used to analyze the various constructs. Findings The results exhibit a positive and significant relationship in NE and absorptive capacity. Also, this study found a positive and significant relationship in absorptive capacity and innovation performance. Moreover, absorptive capacity has a positive and significant mediation role in the relationship between NE and innovation performance. Also, openness positively moderated the relationship of NE and absorptive capacity. Practical implications SMEs should try to implement the functions of NE, such as interaction with other firms in higher frequency, developing trust among all parties, clear alliance among the partners to enhance innovation performance. Similarly, SMEs should focus on absorptive capacity and openness to enrich innovation performance. Originality/value This study adds in the current literature of the chosen constructs and empirically contributes the effects in the manufacturing industry of Jiangsu Province, China.

Using (Szulanski 1996) approach the barriers may occur in relation to, namely, the content of knowledge; context; the source; the recipient.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The methodology is quantitative and the type of research is exploratory and descriptive. For this investigation was used an adapted version of the questionnaire developed by Szulanski (1996), applied to a sample of 79 franchised language schools linked to the Brazilian Franchise Association. Beyond factor analysis it was used the nonparametric test of Jonckheere-Terpstra and analysis of variance, to comparing schools.
   Findings
   The results of this analysis revealed that certain types of knowledge transfers are evaluated by the franchisees as more favorably or unfavorably according to the brand franchise. These results show a lack of standardization trend of the activities of the sales process and mismatches with the guidelines of the franchisor. The authors highlight that in the comparison between the brands is evident the dominance of the CNA in relation to other networks of language franchises when analyzed the relationship factors, technical adequacy, absorption of knowledge, competence to absorb knowledge and in the indicators contribution to revenue, acceptance of guidelines and bring results.
   Originality/value
   This research contributes to the identification of barriers that are involved during the transfer of practices of the franchisor to the franchisee on the knowledge of the sales process in language schools, awakening in franchisee reflections of improvements and solutions that can be worked on and developed in their units. Specifically, the study contributes to the knowledge management literature in franchises, as this topic is still emerging, as it presents conflicting findings.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify the antecedents of successful organizational cross-border knowledge transfer and also the relationship among the antecedents for sustainable competitive advantage.
   Design/methodology/approach - First, a focus group study was conducted to identify major constructs and map out the proposed framework. This is then followed by questionnaire survey from 210 Malaysian multimedia super corridor (MSC) status corporations as recipients. Their international business affiliates refer to any organizations located outside Malaysia with which the recipient firm has a relationship. Data were analysed using SPSS.
   Findings - The findings suggest that the perceived value of the knowledge, relational dimension and cognitive dimension, as well as recipient learning intent and the attractiveness of a foreign source are significant related to the effectiveness of organizational cross-border knowledge transfer.
   Research limitations/implications - Because this research only covered 210 MSC status corporations, future research can try to have more coverage on other industry to have larger sample size for generalizability purposes. Other factors such as organizational and context characteristics can be added as antecedents to strengthen the framework for effective knowledge transfer. Practical implications-The empirical findings can be used as a guideline for MSC status firms to undergo a self-check and help them rethink and reposition themselves in light of the findings. It helps MSC status corporations to frame their organizational cross-border knowledge transfer activities to enable the creation and application of knowledge which should allow them to drive the capability of creating and retaining a greater value onto their core business competencies.
   Originality/value - This study provides valuable insights to help creating a successful foundation for organizational cross-border knowledge transfer. This study is also among few studies to examine the critical antecedents in successful organizational cross-border knowledge transfer from a multidimensional perspective in Malaysia.

AB Purpose This paper aims to systematically review and evaluate extant literature on knowledge acquisition and transfer in international small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) and to identify the requisite types of knowledge acquired and transferred in this context. The research further determines the mechanisms enabling SMEs to process this knowledge, unpacks the benefits of both knowledge acquisition and transfer for international SMEs and links them to the market success. Design/methodology/approach The research has conducted a comprehensive systematic review of existing literature on market knowledge acquisition and its transfer, in the context of international SMEs, utilizing peer-reviewed articles published in top tier journals without any custom range of time. Findings The search strategy resulted in 37 reviewed academic articles, whose analysis identifies and elucidates on the best practices of knowledge acquisition and transfer in the context of international SMEs; the type of the knowledge acquired and transferred; the form and mechanism of the intersection of these processes; and the benefits gained. The findings, crucially, also identify and illuminate extant research gaps and insufficiencies and develop a comprehensive research agenda for the way forward. Originality/value The present study offers a uniquely comprehensive perspective on a topic of diachronic and, currently, rising significance to scholars and practitioners alike. Transcending its descriptive value, though, it further identifies extant knowledge deficiencies, it distils and consolidates critical knowledge and prescribes avenues for research towards the growth and development of international SMEs and born globals.

AB This study aims at improving our understanding of absorptive capacity and the influence of absorptive capacity on technology innovation. We propose using alliance-based network to explore external absorptive capacity and fill the gap of quantitative analysis of the internal and external absorptive capacity together by using social network analysis. In the meanwhile we combine learning effects and absorptive capacity together, to explain how internal absorptive capacity and alliance-based networks cause learning effect, which promotes firms to generate more technological innovation in their home countries and abroad. Using panel data from 306 Chinese firms in high-tech industries during 2001-2010, we find evidence that internal absorptive capacity and external collaborations in alliance-based networks do induce higher technology innovation output, which implies that learning effect depend on the combination of firm-internal and external knowledge. The absorptive capacities, whether internal or external, has positive impact on innovation. Such evidence of absorptive capacity effect has nothing to do with the market position in the process of learning, they are shared among domestic and overseas market Further, in terms of external absorptive capacity, higher network density and degree centrality in the firm's alliance-based network strengthen latecomers' innovation capacity.

AB Purpose - A multinational company (MNC) looking to locate within a cluster is mainly interested in gaining access to scarce and highly valuable tacit knowledge. The transfer of such resources first requires sharing a certain degree of architectural and specific knowledge. This paper aims to examine the transfer of systemic technological expertise (specific tacit knowledge) that is incorporated into organisational practices (architectural knowledge). To quantify the level of knowledge transfer involved, the present study defines the architectural distance between the MNC and the cluster.
   Design/methodology/approach - The mathematical expression of acquisition performance is inferred from a conceptual study that formulates hypotheses regarding the impact of these variables on knowledge transfer. The MNC chooses its location in such a way as to maximise this performance.
   Findings - Applying a mathematical model to knowledge transfer between two of the MNC units helps to determine if the locally acquired knowledge could benefit other units of the MNC.
   Research limitations/implications - The present study defines the architectural distance between the MNC and the cluster. This architectural distance is defined by a vector composed of social, organisational, cultural, institutional, technological and geographic distances between the new acquisition and its network of local partners, on the one hand, and the MNC, on the other. Knowledge transfer also depends on the business players' trust and motivation. Further research through a quantitative study would be useful to improve the links between the proposed mathematical model and the efficiency of an MNC's location within a cluster.
   Practical implications - The solution to the optimisation problem allows to put forward a simple decision criterion to assist a manager who has to face the problem of an optimal location choice.
   Originality/value - First, this study contributes to a better understanding of how knowledge transfer effects may interact with cluster effects, while explaining a subsidiary's performance with regard to location. Second, it provides an interpretation of the concept of knowledge embeddedness by showing that the effective transfer of architectural and specific knowledge involves the prior sharing of a certain amount of this knowledge.

AB Using an original dataset of 4,183 former J-1 Visa holders from 81 countries-all of whom had worked in the U.S.-I examine how skilled return migrants, as cross-border brokers, transfer knowledge about organizational practices from abroad to their home countries. I hypothesize that returnees' knowledge transfer success depends on their embeddedness in both their home-and host-country workplaces and develop and test theory about the organizational and cultural conditions that activate or suppress skilled returnees' ability to broker knowledge across borders. Findings show that not only do host-and home-country embeddedness increase knowledge transfer success, but they also interact positively. At the organizational level, however, the presence of other returnees in a home-country workplace decreases the positive effect of a returnee's host-country embeddedness, whereas the similarity of a returnee's industry background to the home-country industry increases it. At the country level, high xenophobia in a given home country diminishes the positive effect of host-country embeddedness but increases the positive effect of home-country embeddedness. These findings inform an interpersonal perspective on knowledge transfer, contributing to work on brokerage, organizational learning, employee mobility, and the globalization of expert knowledge.

AB The conventional role of corporate headquarters as the sole engine of knowledge creation within the multinational enterprise (MNE) is changing. Increasingly, geographically dispersed subsidiaries need to function as neural networks, reverse transferring knowledge to headquarters. This study explores the attributes that stimulate reverse knowledge transfer within MNEs. Firstly, a multi-perspective model of reverse knowledge transfer (RKT) is created conceptualising the process as predicated upon knowledge creation and knowledge transfer. Constructs of this model are then operationalised within Coats plc, a UK based multinational and global market leader in the textile industry. A key benefit of the proposed new model is that it allows for maps of capabilities in RKT to be created. This has important implications for management practice by providing managers with a potentially significant tool for strategic analysis based upon an integrative perspective on factors underpinning RKT.

AB In this study, we bridge an important gap in the literature by comparing the extent to which external technology spillovers, as indicated by foreign direct investment (FDI), and internal technology spillovers, as indicated by university-institute-industry cooperation (UIC), influence innovation efficiency in China. We divide the innovation process into two sequential stages, namely the knowledge creation and technology commercialization stages, and employ a network data envelopment analysis approach to measure innovation efficiency at each stage. The spatial analysis of the distribution of knowledge creation efficiency and technology commercialization efficiency reveals the heterogeneity of innovation efficiency at the provincial level. Then, a panel data regression is used to analyze the effect of FDI and UIC on innovation efficiency at each stage, using data from 2009 to 2015 for 30 provinces in China. By comparing FDI with UIC, we find that FDI has a higher coefficient and stronger significance level at the knowledge creation stage, while only industry-institute linkages exhibit a stronger association with innovation efficiency at the technology commercialization stage.

AB Since knowledge is a critical resource for ensuring firm growth and survival, firms are increasingly going outside their boundaries and collaborating with other organizations to obtain new knowledge. This study focuses on two distinct self-enforcing safeguards important for interorganizational knowledge transfer. Using survey questionnaire data from senior executives in 180 small to large-sized industrial firms working with university research centers, we focus on the self-enforcing safeguards of self-interest assumption and relational trust and examine the role of each in university-industry knowledge transfer. Results from multiple linear regression show both self-interest assumption and relational trust are positively associated with greater knowledge transfer, however, relational trust is more strongly associated to knowledge transfer than self-interest assumption. We also found that as knowledge becomes more tacit, self-interest assumption becomes negatively associated with knowledge transfer while relational trust becomes more strongly positive. We conclude by discussing implications for future research and management practice.

AB Purpose Knowledge transfer (KT) has been attracting significant attention from the scientific community. The need to establish collaborative network relationships to achieve effective KT has led to a large volume of studies that attempt to identify how collaborative networks influence KT processes. However, papers, which link KT and networks have not been systematised. This study aims to provide an overview of this academic field and sets an agenda for future research. Design/methodology/approach The authors followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses method to conduct a systematic review of the literature published in 2000-2020. The authors sourced the sample from the Web of Science and Scopus databases. The authors screened the references under the management and business categories that were published in the first two quartiles of the Journal Citation Report. This search returned 190 impactful papers across the 53 journals that were analysed. Findings The authors present the main results in two sections. First, this paper elaborates a conceptual model of the field; second, the authors review KT between firms and other agents, which allows us to identify KT flows within and between companies, universities and public institutions. Originality/value This paper provides the first systematic review of collaborative networks and KT. Five areas of action are identified for future research and are specified in several research questions. The authors also provide several practical implications. In a world in which more and more dynamic agents coexist, it is important to be aware of the needs of organisations that create and disseminate specific knowledge.

AB This paper investigates the effect of resource heterogeneity on knowledge Transfer in R&D alliances based on system dynamics method. Based on literature review, we identify the factors that affect knowledge transfer in R&D alliances, and analyse the effect of the organisational and network resource heterogeneity on knowledge transfer in R&D alliances. On this basis, we use system dynamics method to analyse the causality of the effect of the organisational and network resource heterogeneities on knowledge transfer, establish the model of system flow chart, and use Vensim PLE software to perform simulation and sensitivity analyses of the model. The results show that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between the organisational resource heterogeneity and knowledge transfer and that network resource heterogeneity has a positive effect on knowledge transfer in R&D alliances. Our research provides valuable insights into the exploitation of resource heterogeneity in R&D alliances to facilitate effective knowledge transfer.

AB The goal of this paper is to understand better the dynamics of explicit knowledge transfers in the U.S. biopharmaceutical market sector. We draw upon the entrepreneurship and economic geography literature to help explain activity in this sector. We specifically are interested in how location and other factors affect the means, geographic distance, and knowledge base distance of these transfers. We examine explicit knowledge transfers in the form of technologies and products. We examine transfers by private and publicly traded biopharmaceutical firms using a series of binary logistic regression analyses. We find that firms located in bio-clusters are more likely to transfer explicit knowledge locally compared to non-locally. We also find that private firms compared with publicly traded firms and biotechnology firms compared to pharmaceutical firms are more likely to transfer knowledge locally. Pharmaceutical firms are more likely to transfer knowledge via licensing than product acquisitions compared with biotechnology firms. Our study should be of interest to researchers, biopharmaceutical firms, entrepreneurs, and policy makers.

AB Businesses are becoming increasingly involved in collaboration networks to access external knowledge and sustain innovation. In this context, knowledge and knowledge transfer are considered an important source of innovation and competitive advantage. Social capital theory offers a theoretical approach to explain how individuals, groups, and organizations manage relationships and access knowledge resources. The structural dimension of social capital has stimulated debate regarding optimal network configuration to achieve innovation. The extant literature suggests network structures evolve from a bridging configuration to a bonding configuration without examining the details of how the evolution occurs within the network and its stage-by-stage impact on knowledge transfer. This study explores this relationship by analyzing the evolution of a successful Irish pharmaceutical network involving organizations from industry and academia. This research setting encompasses a rare network configuration in an industry known for its lack of collaboration among competing firms., Findings show that structural holes provide access to a set of complementary and heterogeneous knowledge. However, for such knowledge to be exploited, the network configuration has to evolve from a sparse network (small in size and characterized by weak ties across multiple organizational networks), to a large and cohesive network configuration characterized by high levels of commitment, trust, fine-grained information exchange, and joint problem solving. Mechanisms crucial to this evolution include consistently-scheduled meetings, training to communicate tacit knowledge, wide diffusion of knowledge through an on online portal, and relationship specific investments designed to safeguard intellectual property. Surprisingly, industry members appear to transition to a cohesive network faster than do academic members. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore that relational capability plays a mediator role in the relationship between focal enterprises' control on knowledge transfer risks in R&D network. Design/methodology/approach The paper reviews the related literature from which it proposes a theoretical hypothesis and conceptual framework which is tested empirically adopting regression methodology by mathematical statistics software. Findings The results reveal that focal enterprises' control (core technological capability and network position) have a positive effect on knowledge transfer risks without the mediation of relational capability. Moreover, relational capability mediates the positive relationship between core technological capability and knowledge transfer risks.
   Practical implications - The results provide more valuable information to managers in alleviating knowledge transfer risks in R&D networks. For one thing, the study indicates how focal firms' control (core technological capability and network position) can be taken advantage of improving R&D efficiency and reducing the knowledge transfer risks. For another, the results emphasize that relational capability plays an important role in interacting with cooperative enterprises in the process of R&D activities.
   Originality/value Few studies present a theoretical discussion on focal firms control as the important determinants of knowledge transfer risks especially in the R&D network. Moreover it expands the related risk management theory by relational capability that mediates the relationship between focal firms control and knowledge transfer risks.

AB In the recent past, several researchers explored the added-values of Science Parks. On the basis of empirical research, some questioned the assumed benefits of the science park model, whereas others reported positive outcomes. As a result, mixed findings regarding the benefits of science parks for firms can be observed. These mixed empirical findings require a theoretical explanation. This paper argues that different levels and types of knowledge exchange behaviour of science park firms could be one of the theoretical explanations for these mixed findings. The literature on networks mainly stresses the benefits of networking in general, and networking between firms located on science parks in particular. This paper proposes that networks can have both positive (knowledge sharing) and negative effects (opportunistic behavior and knowledge spillovers) for firms located on science parks. When the latter occurs, location on a science park might produce negative effects. A conceptual model is developed that summarises our theoretical arguments.

A comprehensive model, based on agency theory and socialisation theory, is tested on a sample of 134 Finnish and Chinese MNC subsidiaries. Our findings indicate that MNCS can influence inter-unit knowledge transfer by specifying the objectives of the subsidiary and by utilising corporate socialisation mechanisms. However, we found no support for the hypothesised impact of management compensation systems and the use of expatriate managers on the extent of knowledge transfers from foreign subsidiaries to other parts of the MNC.

AB The ability to transfer best practices internally is critical to a firm's ability to build competitive advantage through the appropriation of rents from scarce internal knowledge. Just as a firm's distinctive competencies might be difficult for other firms to imitate, its best practices could be difficult to imitate internally. Yet, little systematic attention has been paid to such internal stickiness. The author analyzes internal stickiness of knowledge transfer and tests the resulting model using canonical correlation analysis of a data set consisting of 271 observations of 122 best-practice transfers in eight companies. Contrary to conventional wisdom that blames primarily motivational factors, the study findings show the major barriers to internal knowledge transfer to be knowledge-related factors such as the recipient's lack of absorptive capacity, causal ambiguity, and an arduous relationship between the source and the recipient.

AB Purpose While numerous studies have studied knowledge transfer (KT) and endeavored to address factors influencing KT, little effort has been made to integrate the findings of prior studies. This paper aims to classify the literature on KT through a detailed exploration of different perspectives of KT inter and intra organizations. Design/methodology/approach Using actor-network theory (ANT) as the baseline, we conducted a systematic review of KT research to summarize prior KT studies and classify the influential factors on KT. The review covered 115 empirical articles published between 1987 and 2017. Findings Drawing on the review and ANT guidelines, the authors proposed a conceptual model to categorize KT constitutes into objects including those related to (1) knowledge, (2) knowledge exchange and (3) technology, as well as actants including those related to (4) organization, (5) team/business unit and (6) knowledge sender/receiver.
   Originality/value While most studies on KT have a narrow focus, this research contributes to holistic understanding of motivational, behavioral, technological and organizational issues related to KT. It also offers a thorough and context-free literature review on KT, which synthesizes the findings of prior studies on KT.

AB An increasing number of studies have examined the impact of collaborative networks on product innovation performance, but have produced inconsistent results. This research contributes to existing literature by examining how absorptive capacity affects the relationships between different types of partners and product innovation performance. The sample used in this research is drawn from the Taiwanese Technological Innovation Survey (TTIS) database. A moderated hierarchical regression approach is used to analyze the models, which are further explored by firm size and industry type. Some interesting findings appear. First, absorptive capacity positively moderates the impact of vertical collaboration on the performance of technologically new or improved products. Second, the effect of absorptive capacity on the relationship between supplier collaboration and the performance of new products with marginal changes varies based on firm size and industry type. Third, absorptive capacity negatively affects the relationship between customer collaboration and the performance of marginally changed products. Fourth, absorptive capacity positively affects the relationship between competitor collaboration and the performance of new products with marginal changes for large firms. Fifth, absorptive capacity negatively affects the relationship between collaboration with research organizations and the performance of technologically new or improved products. On the contrary, absorptive capacity positively affects the impact of collaboration with research organizations on the performance of marginally changed products. These results enrich current understanding of the relationships between collaborative networks and product innovation performance. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As distributed organizations increasingly rely on technological innovations to enhance organizational efficiency and competitiveness, interest in agile practices that enable adoption of information technology (IT) based innovations has grown. This study examines the influence of a network organization environment on the ability to develop agile adoption practices. An exploratory case study design was used to investigate the interactions between network structure, social information processing, organizational similarity (homophily), and absorptive capacity during the adoption of a large-scale IT system in two network organization environments within New York State. The data suggest that network organization characteristics and communication processes that reinforced social influence and supported knowledge transfer positively influenced adoption agility. We propose a model of agile adoption practices and discuss implications for the development of theory about network organization characteristics and capabilities to adopt IT-based innovations.

AB In this paper, we explore under which conditions subsidiaries of multinational corporations can benefit from the external networks of sister subsidiaries in terms of new knowledge generation. We focus on the phenomenon of unconnected sister alliances-that is, alliances of sister subsidiaries with whom the focal subsidiary lacks a recent history of internal R&D collaboration. Whereas unconnected sister alliances provide knowledge recombination opportunities for the focal subsidiary, realizing them is challenging because of particular knowledge transfer frictions. In this paper, we theorize on how particular conditions (i.e., headquarters proximity, knowledge overlap, size of focal subsidiary's own alliance network) influence the strength of these frictions, resulting in hypotheses on how these conditions moderate the relationship between the number of unconnected sister alliances and the generation of new knowledge by focal subsidiaries. We rely on a panel data set of 2,258 R&D subsidiaries belonging to 118 firms in the pharmaceutical industry to empirically test our hypotheses. Jointly, our findings enrich our current theoretical understanding of how different types of external linkages and their interactions shape subsidiaries' generation of new knowledge. We also illuminate the opportunities and challenges that multistep knowledge transfer processes entail.

AB Nonmarket organizations play a supportive role in knowledge transfer and innovation domestically, but national differences between them can create barriers to cross-border knowledge transfer. Internationally oriented nonmarket organizationsones that develop international ties and partnershipsmay generate commonalities among participants and promote a set of similar rules, expectations, and norms across different countries and thus may be effective in supporting cross-border knowledge transfer and innovation. We focus on one such kind of organization, the intergovernmental organization (IGO), as a country's connectedness to learning-oriented IGOs may have a positive influence on national innovation. Using an illustrative caselet on one IGO, the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum, and an empirical analysis spanning 83 countries from 1996 to 2006, we find that the extent of connectedness to the learning-oriented IGO network enables national innovation. But countries differ in the extent to which they can leverage external knowledge for innovation because of the variation in relationships among local constituencies.

AB Innovation intermediaries are critical enablers of inward and outward technology and knowledge transfer processes, particularly in domains and industries that are characterised by high complexity. Nanotechnology as a radical, generic technology is one such domain, which spans a plethora of different industries. As a result, intermediary organisations are essential for the future development and commercialisation of these technologies. However, little is known with regard to the inner workings of intermediaries and the knowledge management (KM) processes and capabilities deployed to facilitate matchmaking. Using an in-depth case study, the paper explores the key knowledge related challenges the intermediary faces and the KM processes and capacities utilised to facilitate intermediation. It is found that knowledge creation and exploration, knowledge storage, and knowledge transfer capacities are key capabilities that are enabled by the intermediary's proprietary access to an extensive network database. Results of the study have implications for both managers engaged or seeking to engage with intermediaries as well as managers of intermediaries.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop and empirically test a theoretical framework examining how local network ties and global network ties affect firms' innovation performance via their absorptive capacities.
   Design/methodology/approach - The conceptual framework is empirically tested in a field study with multi-source data collected from a sample of 297 manufacturing firms located in four. Manufacturing clusters in the south-eastern Yangtze River Delta of China. Hypotheses were tested with the use of path analysis with maximum likelihood robust estimates through the structural equation modelling approach.
   Findings - The asymmetry between local network ties (LNT) and global network ties (GNT) in terms of influences on firms' innovation performance is confirmed by empirical tests. LNT not only significantly and positively contribute to firms' innovation performance directly but also enhance it indirectly via absorptive capability, whereas GNT exhibit only marginal influence on innovation performance. GNT are shown to boost innovation performance (IP) only indirectly via firms' absorptive capacities. Knowledge heterogeneity and the difference between domestic and multinational firms' institutional environment are considered to be the main causes of the asymmetric effects.
   Originality/value - While the previous literature either focused on the mediating role of firms' knowledge absorptive capacities or investigated the effects of social networks separately, this study incorporates both mechanisms into a single analytical framework to better account for the interactions between network effects and absorptive capacities. The results challenge some previous studies positing that GNT are stronger determinants than LNT in shaping a local firm's innovation capacity in emerging economies, and the findings emphasize the importance of absorptive capacity in helping local enterprises to leverage external linkages to enhance firm's innovation performance.

Data from 50 Pakistani-owned Tier 1 suppliers, three of the major assemblers, and policy makers in the Ministry of Industries and Production in Pakistan is collected. Findings suggest that, in the context of the Pakistani emerging economy, IJVs can also play a critical role as the boundary spanners of knowledge transfer. Local suppliers are linked with their global suppliers' networks through associational learning. Social capital between the IJVs and the local component suppliers and the IJVs' willingness to initiate a knowledge transfer dialogue among local and global Tier 1 suppliers are critically important factors that enable this transfer.

AB This meta-analysis serves to integrate evidence about the outcomes of absorbtive capacity (ACAP) resulting from different conceptualizations of its dimensionality. At the conceptual level, we examine three conceptualizations of ACAP-unidimensional, bidimensional, and multidimensional ACAP-and discuss their links to technological innovation and financial performance outcomes. At the empirical level, we examine effect sizes resulting from unidimensional, bidimensional, and multidimensional views of ACAP, and assess the impact of several methodological moderators on the links between ACAP and its outcomes. A total of 330 correlations from 96 studies show that ACAP is positively associated with organizational technological innovation and firm financial performance, and that these relationships are moderated by dimensionality, proxy choice, use of survey versus archival data, and cultural and industry context of the study. Recommendations for future theoretical and empirical studies of ACAP are included.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the innovation performance in the Hungarian food chain using the concept of open innovation.
   Design/methodology/approach - Empirical analysis is based on the data from a 2014 survey of more than 300 small-and medium-sized agricultural producers, food processors and food retailers. The authors analyse innovation performance taking into account not only the direct impacts of external knowledge inflows and absorptive capacity, but also the indirect effect of external knowledge inflows mediated by the existence of potentially complementary internal resources (absorptive capacity). The authors determine the impact of open innovation and a company's absorptive capacity on innovation performance employing two stage approaches. First, the authors apply a semi-non parametric probit model. Second, the authors run cluster analysis to categorize companies based on their open innovation, absorptive capacity, firm and managerial characteristics.
   Findings - Results imply the openness along the food chain may decrease the introduction time of innovation in all areas of innovation, as well the innovation propensity. The openness towards competitors may decrease the introduction time of innovation with regard to technological innovation, but it may increase with regard to product innovation, as well the innovation propensity. The absorptive capacity decreases the introduction time of technological product, organizational and market innovation. There is a positive relationship between the use of external knowledge (when it is defined as openness with competitors) and own innovation capacity with regard to innovation propensity, but not when it is defined as openness along the food chain. The enterprises of the sample are dividing into two groups: innovative (dominated by processors) and not innovative ones (dominated by producers and retailers).
   Research limitations/implications - Some limitations of the paper are worth mentioning. The study is limited in its scope with regard to the research setting and the unit of analysis (Hungarian food chain). With regard to the former, our sample consists of 302 SMEs along the food chain, almost equally distributed as producers, processors and retailers. At the end of 2014 in Hungary there were 7,766 producers, 2,681 processors and 6,420 retailers in this category, which means 1.3 - 3.7 per cent coverage (Agrargazdasagi Kutatointezet, 2014). Regarding the latter, the paper defines food chain in a narrow sense (three levels); therefore, the results represent the perspectives of a limited number of food chain partners (producers, processors, retailers). Were the definition to be widened, input from additional members would be necessary (such as suppliers of suppliers, customers of customers, third parties or competitors). Nevertheless, although the scope may be narrow, it is appropriate for our objective. Future research is recommended to overcome the paper's limitations (i.e. extend its scope to other countries, sectors and levels of chain).
   Practical implications - The analysis provides valuable inputs for policy makers and SMEs along the food chain that wish to build and improve (open) innovation system. Policy makers would need more targeted innovation development programmes in order to solve the tight innovation bottlenecks. These programmes should target first of all at expanding the absorptive capacities of the food chain's enterprises. The authors also need further research in order to investigate how much the restricted use of open innovation systems in the Hungarian food enterprises is linked to the cost and benefits of creation such systems.
   Originality/value - The authors analyse innovation performance taking into account not only the direct impacts of external knowledge inflows and absorptive capacity, but also the indirect effect of external knowledge inflows mediated by the existence of potentially complementary internal resources (absorptive capacity).

AB Bridging three research domains, centrality in R&D alliance networks, knowledge transfer, and the determinants of firm invention output, we develop an interaction model explaining how the centrality-invention output relationship is contingent on the levels of firm inward and outward knowledge transfer. A positive interaction between inward and outward knowledge transfer enhances invention output. However, an invention dissipation effect occurs when central firms have low levels of inward and high levels of outward knowledge transfer. Our findings and implications for managing tensions between inward and outward knowledge transfer are based on an 18-year panel data set including 287 biopharmaceutical firms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Based on the patent and citation data during 1976-2010, the empirical finding are observed as follows. Technological innovation capability of GCC has incrementally increased over time, but GCC deeply relies on other advanced countries in technological innovation. Saudi Arabia plays a predominate position of technological innovation capability in GCC. Basic knowledge is the most effective knowledge resource for enhancing technological innovation capability. Knowledge spillover effect is influenced by geographical distance with GCC. Finally, USA, France, Germany, Great Kingdom and Canada are top five countries of collaborative innovation with GCC.

AB This commentary paper aims to highlight issues associated with the supposed ability to transfer knowledge across networks. In response to the paper "Risks in Organizational Networks: An Exploratory Framework", (Trkman and Desouza, this issue, pp. XXX-XXX), we argue that the taken-for-granted assumption that knowledge is transferrable represents a risk in itself. We analyze knowledge in networks using a practice perspective - in turn we consider knowledge as enacted in social practices and as context-specific. In contrast with Trkman and Desouza's paper, we argue that if knowledge is seen as enacted in practice, a framework that maps risks associated with knowledge transfer is limiting. We conclude that, since knowing in practice is emergent and not fully controllable, adopting a set of best practices on how to effectively transfer (or not) knowledge could itself be risky for managers who then believe that knowledge can be treated as a commodity and easily moved about a network.

AB Building upon knowledge-based and network views, this paper seeks to examine how subsidiary characteristics (subsidiary willingness and subsidiary external embeddedness) and relationship characteristics (internal embeddedness, socialization mechanisms and shared values) impact the extent of Reverse Knowledge Transfer (RKT).
   A survey was carried out to build a database of 178 subsidiaries operating in Knowledge Intensive Business Service (KIBS) sectors in the United Kingdom.
   Our analysis indicates that willingness and socialization mechanisms are the most significant determinants of the extent of RKT. Further, the impacts of shared values and internal embeddedness are mediated by subsidiary willingness. The results also highlight the significant association between socialization mechanisms and internal embeddedness. Contrary to our expectation, external embeddedness has a negative influence on the extent of RKT.

AB This paper investigates the impact of both geographical and relational proximity on the innovative performance of the firm. We address the role of one firm characteristic-its absorptive capacity-as a specific contingency affecting the relationship between different proximities and innovation. Using data from 158 high-tech firms located in the Tiburtina Valley in Italy, we studied the relationship between these firms and their key customers. Our findings support the need to downplay the role of geographical proximity in promoting innovation. Our results also show that relational proximity to key customers has a complementary relationship with absorptive capacity, which positively moderates its influence on innovative performance.

AB We propose that individual-level knowledge transfer between subsidiaries within a multinational enterprise depends on the perceived relative power of the subsidiary and the cultural intelligence of individuals. Using a sample of 333 research and development (R&D) subsidiary employees of foreign Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) in India, we find that the perceived subsidiary power has a direct positive significant effect on knowledge sharing, and an indirect significant effect, through organizational identification, on knowledge seeking. Further, cultural intelligence moderates the effect of organizational identification on knowledge seeking, and the indirect effect of the perceived subsidiary power on it. The findings highlight the role of organizational identification and cultural intelligence in explaining the impact of the perceived subsidiary power on interpersonal knowledge transfer within the MNE.

AB The MNE integration literature lacks coherence in the use and effectiveness of different integration mechanisms. In this study, we use meta-analytic techniques to quantitatively synthesize and evaluate the impact of centralization, formalization and socialization on knowledge transfer. Our analysis of 89 independent samples, including 15,506 subsidiaries, shows that socialization facilitates knowledge transfer more strongly than centralization and formalization. Socialization substitutes for formalization's positive impact, and mitigates centralization's negative impact on knowledge transfer. We further identify that directionality of knowledge flows is key in explaining the impact of centralization mechanisms. Finally, we point out important systemic problems in current empirical research.

AB This paper examines the transfer of entrepreneurship education best practices from business schools to engineering and technology institutions. Nations like Pakistan need to educate their youth enrolled in large numbers in engineering and technology disciplines, to unleash their entrepreneurial potential to address the challenge of unemployment and hence economic development. Like rest of the world most entrepreneurship education programs in the country are generally offered by business and management schools. The article provides a cost effective approach of transferring the entrepreneurship education best practices developed at the Institute of Business Administration Karachi to five regional engineering and technology institutions. This paper employs the knowledge-transfer theoretical lens using the action research methodology to understand the application of various interventions to transfer entrepreneurship education practices. The results show that the success of these transfer efforts depends on several factors, including quality of the program, quality of the transfer team, absorptive capacity of the receiver and various contextual and motivational factors. Other developing countries with similar challenges can also benefit from the model.

AB The aim of this article is to examine how externally recruited, highly skilled (re-)migrants facilitate cross-border knowledge transfers in multinational enterprises (MNEs). To achieve this goal, an actor-centred research perspective will be adopted, which allows for a detailed examination of both individual employees involved in MNEs cross-border knowledge transfers as well as organizational strategies to facilitate and structure knowledge transfers. Empirically, the article is based on the example of highly skilled (re-)migrants of Turkish origin, who obtained a university degree in Germany, then (re-)migrated to Turkey and work in subsidiaries of German MNEs. The empirical results show that highly skilled (re-)migrants of Turkish origin are strategically used to work at interface positions between German and Turkish business units. Based on their professional expertise, dual societal embeddedness and profound language skills, highly skilled (re-)migrants facilitate cross-border knowledge transfers by building social proximity and bridging institutional distances. Overall, the article contributes to the micro-foundation of cross-border knowledge transfers in MNEs.

AB This study investigates (i) differences in knowledge intermediation strategies among knowledge and technology transfer organizations (KTTOs) and (ii) the factors that explain such differences. It uses data from 212 Canadian KTTOs. When knowledge delivery capacity (KDC) and knowledge integration capacity (KIC) dimensions of knowledge intermediation are simultaneously accounted for, four categories of KTTOs emerge, namely, (1) knowledge stores; (2) knowledge match providers; (3) knowledge integrators; and (4) knowledge brokers. This heterogeneity results in a differentiation in KTTOs' service delivery strategies. Factors that are conducive to custom-made solutions include (i) increased innovativeness; (ii) higher absorptive capacity; (iii) stronger information search and storage capabilities; (iv) effective customer knowledge management (CKM); and (v) increased networking capabilities. Larger knowledge intermediaries suffer from internal organizational stickiness that prevents them from delivering custom-made services. KTTOs with a low degree of formalization and centralization in decision-making are likely to adopt intermediation strategies aimed at reaching the largest possible number of users. Some managerial and public policy implications are drawn.

TI Knowledge sharing and knowledge management system avoidance: The role of

AB Knowledge sharing is a difficult task for most organizations, and there are many reasons for this. In this article, we propose that the nature of the knowledge shared and an individual's social network influence employees to find more value in person-to-person knowledge sharing, which could lead them to bypass the codified knowledge provided by a knowledge management system (KMS). We surveyed employees of a workman's compensation board in Canada and used social network analysis and hierarchical linear modeling to analyze the data. The results show that knowledge complexity and knowledge teachability increased the likelihood of finding value in person-to-person knowledge transfer, but knowledge observability did not. Contrary to expectations, whether the knowledge was available in the KMS had no impact on the value of person-to-person knowledge transfer. In terms of the social network, individuals with larger networks tended to perceive more value in the person-to-person transfer of knowledge than those with smaller networks.

AB In the present study, a new framework was established for studying the evolution of strategic alliance innovation system. Based on data from 514 questionnaires, knowledge absorption capacity, knowledge potential, and knowledge transfer capacity were extracted to constitute variables for strategic alliance innovation system, and incentive mechanism was taken as a control variable for system evolution. A dynamic system evolution model was established based on the correlations between variables, for the purpose of analyzing correlations between knowledge absorption capacity, knowledge potential, knowledge transfer capacity and their evolution trends under incentives of different intensities. The following findings were obtained: Incentive mechanism can promote the evolution of strategic alliance innovation system, and strong incentives can shorten the cycle of system evolution. In the evolution of strategic alliance innovation system, knowledge absorption capacity is a core variable dominating system evolution and is positively correlated with knowledge transfer capacity. The gap between knowledge sources and recipients gradually narrows, and there is a critical value of knowledge potential for improving knowledge absorption capacity and knowledge transfer capacity. Under the premise of enhanced knowledge absorption capacity, the evolution of the innovation system is more stable when knowledge transfer capacity and knowledge potential reach a relatively balance state.

AB Purpose This paper aims to provide a theoretical frame and practical experience for understanding and improving knowledge creation in the RIC. This paper proved through an empirical study that knowledge transfer, knowledge assimilation and knowledge sharing between firms in a resource-based industry chain (RIC) have positive influence on knowledge creation.
   Design/methodology/approach A theoretical model covering knowledge transfer, knowledge assimilation, knowledge sharing and knowledge creation is established in this paper. The research object is the phosphorus chemical industry chain in central Guizhou.
   Findings The findings of this paper provide a theoretical frame and practical experience for understanding and improving knowledge creation in the RIC.
   Research limitations/implications The subjective measures of knowledge capacities present a serious limitation. Another limitation is that the authors examined knowledge creation within the context of RIC. The cross-sectional design prevented the authors from studying causal relationships among the variables.
   Originality/value First, it contributes to the knowledge creation of inter-organization literature. Second, it contributes to the studies of knowledge creation in supply chains. Third, this study demonstrates the importance of investigating the strong network embeddedness and industry property of RIC, which have a critic effect on the capabilities of knowledge sharing, transfer and assimilation.

AB This paper contributes to an empirical validation of R&D outsourcing by integrating the influence of internal capabilities, network resources and appropriation mechanisms. Internal capabilities refer to internal R&D and human capital. Network resources account for decisions to outsource R&D which co-depend on informal incoming knowledge spillovers. Appropriation accounts for formal and informal knowledge protection mechanisms. This empirical study discusses the determinants of R&D outsourcing with respect to various theories of the firm that complement each other.
   Data from the Third and Fourth European Community Innovation Survey for Belgium reveal internal R&D intensity to exert a strong positive association with R&D outsourcing intensity, emphasising the importance of absorptive capacity and the complementary nature of internal and outsourced R&D. Network resources are also positively associated, suggesting that firms involved in a mixture of informal and formal networks tend to outsource relatively more R&D. In terms of appropriation mechanisms there is a positive association formal and informal protection, but this last mostly through complexity of design. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Transferring a quantity of credible knowledge is a key competitive advantage for vertical relationships in an emerging economy. Distinct from extant research focused on the relational performance of and opportunism in channel relationships or knowledge transfer in horizontal alliances, this study investigates knowledge transfer in vertical relationships and considers how transactional and relational mechanisms differentially affect knowledge transfer quantity and credibility. Hierarchical regression analyses of 225 paired buyers and suppliers in China revealed that both transactional and relational mechanisms effectively improve quantity and credibility; within a transactional mechanism framework, contracts more effectively increase quantity, whereas transaction-specific investments do not increase credibility more effectively than contracts; and, trust more effectively improves both quantity and credibility in the relational mechanism framework than personal relationships. These findings provide new insights for the knowledge management literature and practices in vertical relationships. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In response to recent calls for more research on micro-foundations, we seek to link human resource management (HRM) and knowledge transfer through individual-level mechanisms, arguing that individual-level conditions of action influence the extent to which employees engage in knowledge exchange. We examine four such conditions empirically using data from 811 employees in three Danish multinational corporations (MNCs). Our findings suggest that individual-level perceptions of organizational commitment to knowledge sharing, and extrinsic motivation, directly influence the extent to which employees engage in firm-internal knowledge exchange. We also find that intrinsic motivation and engagement in social interaction significantly mediate the relationship between perceived organizational commitment and knowledge exchange. Given that HRM can influence such conditions through an overall signaling effect and various practices, an understanding of these micro-foundations will shed light on how organizations can effectively enhance knowledge transfer through HRM.

AB Purpose - This paper attempted to verify the process by which a multinational corporation (MNC)'s subsidiary practices entrepreneurship to create effective knowledge (KC) in the local market. We have looked at whether subsidiary entrepreneurship (SENT) has a moderation effect in creating knowledge for the local market when a subsidiary has been given autonomy (AUT) from the headquarters (HQ). We also argue that when a subsidiary creates meaningful knowledge, the effect of the increased status by the HQ within the MNC network position (NP) has an indirect effect on whether knowledge is transferred to other overseas subsidiaries (KTO).
   Design/methodology - This paper used a structural equation model (SEM) of 282 effective foreign companies invested in Korea. To test the hypothesis about the process of SENT on KTO, descriptive statistics, confirmatory factor analysis, reliability, convergent and discriminant validities, and common method bias were analyzed using STATA. In addition, the moderation effect was verified along with SEM. The moderation effect of AUT on SENT and KC was presented graphically by confirming \mathrm{\pm1} standard deviation of AUT for the main effect.
   Findings - Our findings are as follows. First, while the hypothesis about the direct effect of SENT and KC on KTO was not supported, all other hypotheses were supported. Second, both the AUT and moderating effect and the indirect effect of NP were significant. In the conclusion, these findings are discussed in relation to its various theoretical and practical implications.
   Originality/value - This study attempted to contribute to the knowledge creation theory of MNC by contemplating how subsidiaries can move away from HQ and grow in the local market. Although there is still a shortage of foreign investment in the Korean market, our practical implications offer guidance for how current subsidiaries can develop more than other overseas subsidiaries.

AB The aim of this paper is to improve understanding of the spatial diffusion process of knowledge in terms of accessibility, and also to elaborate a new measurement and evaluation tools adapted to a concrete estimation of these phenomena. This approach offers ways of giving an operational content to the concept of proximity. The 'potential functions' used to measure geographical accessibility is enriched with the integration of the characteristics of knowledge diffusion, namely sources of externalities/knowledge, ways of transmission, and absorptive capacity. The paper especially focuses on the relational and strategic dimensions of proximity by using some developments from social networks analysis. Such an approach leads to new empirical models for estimating the determinants of accessibility to knowledge.

AB This paper focuses on the multifaceted role of language and language-sensitive recruitment in knowledge transfer in multinational corporations (MNCs). In particular, we develop a framework that helps to better understand how language-sensitive recruitment is related to competence, networks, identity, and power. We started by conducting a qualitative interview-based study of 101 MNC subsidiaries. This analysis elucidates the productive and counterproductive effects of language-sensitive recruitment on knowledge transfer related to communication competence, networks, identity, and power. To further understand the productive and counterproductive effects, we conducted a quantitative study in 285 MNC subsidiaries. We found an inverted U-shaped relationship between language-sensitive recruitment and knowledge transfer. Together, these two studies provide a better understanding of the multifaceted and at times counter-intuitive implications of language-sensitive recruitment on knowledge transfer in MNCs. By elucidating these effects, this paper contributes to the stream of research examining the role of language in MNCs and international business more generally. It further adds to research on MNC knowledge transfer that to date has focused little attention on language. By elaborating on the potential unintended consequences of language-sensitive recruitment, this paper also has implications for international human resource management research.

AB We focus in this study on sets of inter-organizational relationships (IORs) by applying a configurational approach that includes both the diversity and the intensity of knowledge transfer IORs. We use a latent class cluster analysis to empirically explore the kinds of IORs configurations We then use antecedents derived from the IOR literature to explain firm membership in those configurations Our tests allow us to identify four configurations ranging from isolated innovators to innovating firms embedded in diverse and deep sets of IORs. We show that internal knowledge use by firms, and the types of innovative activities in which they engage, are strong predictors of firm membership in different configurations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB Purpose The aim of the paper is to identify the determinants of the marketing and managerial knowledge transfer from a foreign subsidiary located in a post-transition country to its headquarters established in a developed country. Design/methodology/approach The authors combined the critical literature studies and empirical research, where the method of Computer-assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) was applied. The empirical data was gathered from 231 manufacturing foreign subsidiaries established in Poland (as one of the post-transition economy). To test the hypotheses logistic regression was applied. Findings The knowledge accumulated in the foreign subsidiary, the amount and level of novelty of innovation in the foreign subsidiary and its strategic autonomy is crucial for the occurrence of the reverse knowledge transfer. However, the more powerful the foreign subsidiary is, the less eager it is to transfer marketing and managerial knowledge to the headquarters. Research limitations/implications The study is concentrated just on the manufacturing sector in the Polish economy. The results are based on the opinions and perception of managers, but they represent the corporate perspective (not their individual ones). Practical implications The study provokes asking the question about the proper level of strategic autonomy of a foreign subsidiary. The implication related to the autonomy is much about the proper strategy for human resources management. The obtained results indicate that the intensity of innovation in a foreign subsidiary "translates" to the outflow of knowledge from a foreign subsidiary to its headquarters. Thus, encourages headquarters to let their subsidiaries innovate still monitoring their power. Social implications FSs are entities more or less embedded in the host markets, thus their strength and sustainable existence is important for their stakeholders, in particular - internal entities such as employees and external entities such as suppliers, and other cooperating organisations and institutions in the host market. The contribution of FSs to the innovation performance and knowledge pool of external partners is determined much by their absorptive capacity. Thus, the results obtained indirectly point to the importance of external agents ability to absorb and exploit the knowledge. Originality/value The originality of the paper concerns three issues. Firstly, the previous studies are mainly focused on either developed or emerging markets and as a result, the peculiarity of post-transition economies, like Poland has been neglected. Secondly, the determinants of reverse knowledge transfer are presented from the corporate perspective. Thirdly, authors focus on marketing and management knowledge distributed from a foreign subsidiary to its headquarter.

AB No business can create all the resources needed to prosper and grow. Collaboration among businesses that possess complementary resources is often necessary for survival and growth. Despite their importance and implications for alliance learning, no empirical study has to date attempted to investigate how the determinants of learning interact with each other, and are linked to the outcomes of alliance learning. This study contributes to the role of learning intent, absorptive capacity, and relational capital in enhancing learning activities and outcomes by empirically examining the relationships among these learning determinants and how they affect innovative SMEs' technological and nontechnological learning in alliance relationships.

AB Emerging markets (EM) are becoming increasingly important for multinational enterprises because of their high growth potential and future prospects. The unique circumstances in EM lead to increased pressure to offer creative marketing solutions that can be leveraged across the multinational network. Setting up subsidiaries to tap into these markets offers companies the opportunity to integrate in the local community and access its knowledge-base for local and global innovations. Literature, however, reveals that EM subsidiaries have been largely ignored concerning their potential for reverse knowledge transfer (RKT), and marketing initiatives are expected to be developed in mature, developed markets. Our paper fills this gap in research and contributes to extant literature by identifying factors at unit, relationship and knowledge levels influencing RKT potential specific to marketing knowledge from EM subsidiaries. The discussion leads to study propositions and conceptual framework.

AB This study examines the influence of external sources of knowledge on innovation in a sample of Spanish manufacturing firms during the period 2002-2015. By differentiating firms according to their family status, our results reveal that the probability of engaging in product and process innovations is higher for family-managed firms involved in R&D cooperation with a varied group of partners. Additionally, our findings provide support for the role of R&D-oriented family-managed firms in easing the flow of knowledge and information for innovation at regional level (i.e. family firm-led knowledge spillovers). Because of their unique social capital and embeddedness in the local setting, family-managed firms contribute to creating a favourable regional environment for innovation for all co-located firms. However, this result holds only when the geographical concentration of R&D-oriented family-managed firms is coupled with technological proximity. Theoretical, policy and managerial implications are discussed.

AB The objectives of this study are to investigate whether foreign acquiring firms contribute towards enhancing technological capabilities of local firms in foreign markets. Given that drivers promoting technology acquisition from acquiring firms have been largely neglected in the literature, we attempt to identify the key factors influencing this phenomenon. Secondly, although several studies have discussed knowledge exchange through international acquisitions (IAs), little attention has been given to small and medium sized local acquired firms (SMLFs). By using three dimensions of organizational characteristics based on absorptive capacity, our empirical evidence reveals three key findings. First, to develop an effective absorptive capacity, mere exposure to favorable learning environments is not sufficient, and that intensity of effort is a critical component functioning as a facilitator towards the extent of learning. Second, what is already known can be improved when partners share similar business background. This is because the possession of relevant knowledge based on business relatedness increases the boundary of curriculum in organizations. Third, collaborative support from knowledge transferors is a significant catalyst generating a specific learning capability. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Using in-depth data from 155 Pakistani auto components suppliers, we study the role of socialization in knowledge transfer from international joint venture assemblers. We find that whereas formal socialization mechanisms enhance the comprehension and speed of knowledge transfer to local suppliers, informal socialization mechanisms enhance comprehension but not speed. Building on structural contingency theory, we find that having a mechanistic organizational structure among knowledge recipients is an antecedent to formal socialization, leading to improved knowledge transfer.

AB While university-industry collaboration has received widespread attention in academic literature and policy making, there is still limited knowledge on how low-capacity SMEs engage in open innovation activities. Building on a survey conducted among Estonian SMEs with limited innovation capacity, our research focuses specifically on aspects that help low-capacity SMEs and academic researchers to collaborate. The sample was selected purposefully using an innovation voucher database. Our research results indicate that collaboration is fostered by the perceived symmetry of motivation between partners, or paradoxically, the perceived higher motivation of the academic partner rather than the motivation of the SME itself. Our analysis suggests that motivation symmetry between partners plays a crucial role in determining the collaboration process and outcome between low-capacity SMEs and academic researchers.

AB Purpose Based on the knowledge-based theories of the MNC, this research aims to develop and test a holistic model to analyse the relationship between the strategic knowledge management (SKM) processes undertaken by subsidiaries and MNC performance. Additionally, it focuses on determining the impact that the relational context can have on knowledge creation and transfer inside the internal network of an MNC.
   Design/methodology/approach The research hypotheses are tested by partial least squares (PLS) with data from a sample of Spanish subsidiaries of foreign multinational firms belonging to high-technology and knowledge-intensive sectors.
   Findings The results confirm that: the implementation of a SKM by a subsidiary positively impacts on knowledge creation; the knowledge created by a subsidiary positively influences knowledge transfer, increasing the knowledge existing in the MNC; the knowledge transfer across all MNC units has a positive impact on MNC performance; the subsidiary's relational context arises as a mediating variable between the knowledge created by a subsidiary and its transfer to the rest of the MNC.
   Originality/value The research proposes a holistic model that contemplates the joint interaction of the variables knowledge creation, knowledge transfer and performance. In addition, the proposed model contemplates the variable SMK of the subsidiary as the beginning of the knowledge creation-knowledge transfer-performance process. Finally, the mediating role of the relational context in the relationship between knowledge creation and transfer is analysed.

AB How do internal resources, relational resources, and relational mechanisms determine knowledge transfer among crucial partners in clusters? We analyze a sample of Spanish footwear manufacturers to distinguish the relative impact of internal resources, intra-cluster relationships, and governance (including power asymmetries) on knowledge transfer between leading firms and their partners. Internal resources appear to be highly beneficial for knowledge transfer among partners, while intra-cluster relationships diminish such transmissions. The governance structure of the partnership also appears to have an important influence on knowledge transfer between leading organizations and their suppliers. These results suggest valuable implications for practitioners, researchers, and policy makers at both the firm and meso levels.

AB Knowledge management is increasingly recognized as a key aspect of international business and management. This paper offers research avenues for investigating knowledge transfer between self-initiated expatriates (SIEs) and their employer organizations. Building on the existing literature on expatriation and knowledge transfer, it offers a series of research propositions. It illustrates the knowledge transfer process in three phases: opportunity seeking, knowledge sharing, and knowledge application. We suggest that different characteristics of SIEs and their organizations can influence the knowledge transfer process. Furthermore, we advance that SIEs may be a source of sustained competitive advantage to their companies. Several implications for future empirical research are also discussed and the paper concludes with practical implications for SIE talent management.

AB Purpose This paper represents an empirical study of how geographic proximity influences the search advantage and the transfer problem of interfirm networks. Design/methodology/approach By using the data collected from 226 Chinese manufacturing firms, this study examines the proposed hypotheses. Findings The authors' findings suggest that (1) geographic proximity is an important antecedent for promoting knowledge transfer, whereas it lowers the degree of knowledge novelty; and (2) geographic proximity also moderates the effects of interfirm networks on knowledge novelty and knowledge transfer. Originality/value This study contributes the literature of interfirm network and provides practical implications by addressing the ways in which manufacturing firms can promote knowledge transfer and acquire novel knowledge.

AB This paper contributes to the developing literature on the management of distributed innovation in multinational firms. We focus on a specific organizational mechanism, R& D co-practice, which we believe is an important facilitator of knowledge integration in multinationals with global innovation strategies. In our formulation, R& D co-practice ( joint technical activities between units) increases levels of absorptive capacity and social capital among participating units, thus increasing the likelihood that they will share knowledge at future time periods. We find strong support for this hypothesis through an empirical analysis of 'reverse' ( subsidiary to headquarters) knowledge integration in two sectors - automotive and pharmaceuticals - over a 21-year period.

AB This conceptual paper adds to the theoretical exploration of inter-organisational pro-environmental knowledge transfer in small and medium sized tourism enterprises (SMTEs). It does so by focusing on the role of trust, a concept which has received only scant attention in this context. Drawing on theoretical and empirical research, we argue that the willingness of SMTE managers to engage in the transference of pro-environmental tacit knowledge is based on their intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, coupled with the perceived trustworthiness of both the message and social actors involved. It remains a challenge for SMTE managers to receive, absorb and respond to appropriate pro-environmental knowledge, based on organisational needs. The paper makes an important contribution to the work on pro-environmental knowledge transfer in tourism by proposing a model of four key antecedents of trust in the knowledge transfer process - self- efficacy, social norms, credibility of knowledge source and social capital between actors. We identify a future research agenda including the need to assess the weighted impact of each antecedent of trust; establish the influence of tourism networks on trust formation and development; and explore if peer perception intervenes in tacit knowledge transfer between pro-active and reactive SMTE managers.

AB Despite the growing acknowledgement that entrepreneurship is an important driver of regional innovation and growth, the role of the networks in these processes has been less formally examined. In order to address this gap, this paper proposes that the relationship between entrepreneurship, innovation and regional growth is governed by a series of network dynamics. Drawing upon aspects of endogenous growth theory and the knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship, it is proposed that the nature of the networks formed by entrepreneurial firms is a key determinant of regional growth differentials. In particular, network capital, in the form of investments in strategic relations to gain access to knowledge, is considered to mediate the relationship between entrepreneurship and innovation-based regional growth. It is suggested that network dynamics should be further incorporated into theories concerning the link between knowledge spillovers, entrepreneurship and regional growth. The paper concludes with a series of theoretical, entrepreneurial and policy implications emerging from the study.

AB Recent academic discourse on innovation clusters has emphasized the need to analyze cluster performance from a micro-level and meso-level perspective. Grounded in literature from economic geography, network theory, and organizational learning, this study discusses the structure of collaborative ties and its effect on the absorptive capacity and innovation performance of cluster firms. Focusing on the concept of social brokerage, the findings show that bridging structural holes and connecting pairs of other actors are conducive to a firm's absorptive capacity and innovation performance. Overall, this study suggests that the locus of innovation lies in the structure of a firm's external collaboration network as well as internal capabilities to exploit the network externalities.

Based on three leading theoretical perspectives transaction costs, social networks and absorptive capacity - we develop hypotheses focusing on the role of technology-based advantage, the social networks of start-up team members and the absorptive capacity of employees in predicting entry mode choice and new venture internationalization performance. Using data on the internationalization of new Korean ventures, we find evidence that social network and absorptive capacity theories have considerable explanatory power beyond that of transaction cost theory in predicting entry mode choice and the internationalization performance of new ventures.

AB A technical standards alliance (TSA) is a collection of firms organized for a common goal: developing, revising, and promoting technical standards. A firm may participate in standardization through one or more TSAs: its TSA network. However, little is known about the influencing factors and their boundary conditions for gaining firm level benefits from such involvement. This study fills this gap. Drawing on a network perspective on standardization, we examine the effect of the firm's TSA network and its absorptive capacity. Using a sample of 437 Chinese IT and automotive industry firms participating in non-governmental Chinese standardization groups, we find positive impacts of participation. A firm's central position and relationship strength within a TSA network positively affect firm performance, and absorptive capacity contributes to this effect. Environmental uncertainty acts as a moderator in the relationship between absorptive capacity and firm performance. These findings add to the literature on the impacts of standardization and are informative for companies that consider participating in standardization.

AB While most literature promotes a positive impact of social capital on various organizational performance outcomes, empirical results on the social capital-organizational performance link are not conclusive. We propose that one reason for the discordant findings is that research has largely not accounted for the mediating process steps that translate social capital into organizational performance outcomes. We suggest that organizational performance outcomes of organization members' social capital hinge on the mediating processes of resource mobilization, assimilation, and use. An empirical study of 218 projects in the German engineering industry supports our theoretical model. Findings show that knowledge transfer (conceptualized as the mobilization, assimilation, and use of knowledge resources) mediates between organization members' intra-organizational social capital and organizational performance outcomes of growth and innovation performance. The present study thus contributes to a deeper understanding of the value of intra-organizational social capital.

AB While 'knowledge mobility' presents significantly different challenges for SMEs and MNCs, it is strongly influenced by two common factors: the type of knowledge to be integrated and the configuration of the operations network. Here, SMEs and MNCs are required to make critical decisions about 'levels' of collaboration and knowledge sharing with network partners. A Knowledge Mobility Configuration (KMC) framework was developed, tested and refined using five case studies indicative of a growing shift towards information and knowledge-intensive activities. In terms of contribution, there has been limited empirical research to-date into the determinants of successful knowledge transfers in MNC-SME network contexts. The network configuration element of the KMC framework provides insights on how such networks evolve, and how specific knowledge mobility profiles may evolve over time. This more nuanced approach may be used as a basis for a proactive and differentiated approach to knowledge mobility and integration across SME and MNC networks.

AB This article focuses on public organizations to contribute to research on knowledge management processes, a field that until recently has focused primarily on private entities. Specifically, we analyse the mediating role of knowledge transfer and knowledge absorption in the relationship between the internal networking created in university research groups and innovation ambidexterity. Based on six hypotheses, the conceptual model is tested through a structural equations model with mediation effects. The data analysed come from 249 directors of Spanish public university research groups. The results show that the internal networking formed in university research groups has a positive and significant relationship to knowledge transfer and knowledge absorption, but we obtain different results for the relationship between knowledge transfer and knowledge absorption in the presence of innovation ambidexterity. Only knowledge absorption has a positive and significant influence on innovation ambidexterity. The most interesting results involve the mediating role of knowledge absorption in the relationship between internal networking and innovation ambidexterity. These results support the conclusion that directors of university research groups should promote development of knowledge absorption processes in order to stimulate innovation ambidexterity and thus to achieve ambidextrous innovative performance.

AB This study draws on the knowledge management and social network disciplines to examine the effect of network closure on organizations' competitive advantage. We hypothesize that the level of network closure affects an organization's capability of knowledge identification, knowledge transfer, knowledge protection and knowledge institutionalization; these capabilities in turn affect an organization's competitive advantage. Thus, we model network closure as indirectly affecting an organization's competitive advantage. A Partial Least Square (PLS) analysis of the survey data of 78 Chinese petrochemical firms shows that network closure can both enhance and decrease an organization's competitive advantage. Network closure enhances an organization's competitive advantage by facilitating knowledge protection and transfer (via institutionalization), but decreases competitive advantage by hindering knowledge identification. Environmental dynamics that the organizations encounter are observed to moderate the effect of network closure. Combining our results with the findings from the literature, we propose that organizations operating in a dynamic environment, where the domain knowledge is in a state of flux, need to place great importance on knowledge identification; such organizations should choose a sparse network that allows them to receive diverse knowledge. In contrast, organizations operating in a stable environment should opt for a dense network to protect their knowledge and facilitate transfer of required knowledge. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB Drawing on the opportunity-motivation-ability perspective, this study examines the linkages of business and political ties to exploratory innovation, and explores the joint moderating effects of innovation orientation and absorptive capacity on the linkages. It finds that the positive linkage between business ties and exploratory innovation is jointly strengthened by innovation orientation and absorptive capacity, while the insignificant linkage of political ties to exploratory innovation is moderated negatively by the interaction of innovation orientation and absorptive capacity. This study enriches the discipline's knowledge on the antecedents of exploratory innovation. Moreover, it contextualizes the effects of managerial ties on an important but overlooked type of innovation-exploratory innovation-and illustrates how a firm can integrate managerial ties with innovation orientation and absorptive capacity to realize their implications for exploratory innovation, which advances our understanding of the relationships between managerial ties and firm innovations.

AB As valuable resources for incubating firms, knowledge resources have received gradually increasing attention from all types of business incubators, and business incubators use a variety of knowledge services to stimulate rapid growth in incubating firms. Based on previous research, we generalize the knowledge transfer and knowledge networking services of two main forms of knowledge services and further divide knowledge transfer services into knowledge depth services and knowledge breadth services. Then, we construct the business incubators' knowledge supernetwork model, describe the evolution mechanism among heterogeneous agents and utilize a simulation to explore the performance variance of different business incubators' knowledge services. The simulation results show that knowledge stock increases faster when business incubators are able to provide knowledge services to more incubating firms and that the degree of discrepancy in the knowledge stock increases during the process of knowledge growth. Further, knowledge transfer services lead to greater differences in the knowledge structure, while knowledge networking services lead to smaller differences. Regarding the two types of knowledge transfer services, knowledge depth services are more conducive to knowledge growth than knowledge breadth services, but knowledge depth services lead to greater gaps in knowledge stocks and greater differences in knowledge structures. Overall, it is optimal for business incubators to select a single knowledge service or portfolio strategy based on the amount of time and energy expended on the two types of knowledge services.

AB Purpose - In the globalized economy, it is becoming increasingly necessary for firms in emerging economies to adopt advanced knowledge and technology from external sources, both domestic and abroad. This paper aims to identify knowledge flows through domestic and international customer-supplier relationships that cause gaps in quality assurance, cost reduction, and timely delivery among firms in emerging countries.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors constructed an original dataset on production networks within manufacturing firms in Vietnam (including Hanoi and the surrounding region) and estimated statistical models for the relationship between face-to-face interactions within a supply chain and QCD (Quality, Cost, Delivery). Findings from in-depth interviews with Japanese firms in emerging economies complement the quantitative analysis.
   Findings - The incidence of face-to-face interactions between two firms within a production chain via resident engineers significantly explains the variation in performance of total quality management among firms in Vietnam under controlling vertical ownership within a chain. Since the authors could find no significant correlations between transactions of goods along the supply chain and QCD, it is safe to say that transfer of intangible assets among interconnected firms may cause the difference in QCD among firms in Vietnam.
   Originality/value - This represents the first systematic quantitative research on the asymmetric gains from face-to-face interactions with downstream and upstream firms, and it offers a new development in the study of transfers of intangible assets within a supply chain in Asian emerging economies.

AB The aims of this work are: (1) to extend knowledge dynamics analysis in order to assess the influence of false beliefs and unreliable communication channels, (2) to investigate the impact of selection rule-policy for knowledge acquisition, (3) to investigate the impact of targeted link attacks ("breaks" or "infections") of certain "healthy" communication channels. We examine the knowledge dynamics analytically, as well as by simulations on both artificial and real organizational knowledge networks. The main findings are: (1) False beliefs have no significant influence on knowledge dynamics, while unreliable communication channels result in non-monotonic knowledge updates ("wild" knowledge fluctuations may appear) and in significant elongation of knowledge attainment. Moreover, false beliefs may emerge during knowledge evolution, due to the presence of unreliable communication channels, even if they were not present initially, (2) Changing the selection rule-policy, by raising the awareness of agents to avoid the selection of unreliable communication channels, results in monotonic knowledge upgrade and in faster knowledge attainment, (3) "Infecting" links is more harmful than "breaking" links, due to "wild" knowledge fluctuations and due to the elongation of knowledge attainment. Moreover, attacking even a "small" percentage of links (<= 5%) with high knowledge transfer, may result in dramatic elongation of knowledge attainment (over 100%), as well as in delays of the onset of knowledge attainment. Hence, links of high knowledge transfer should be protected, because in Information Warfare and Disinformation, these links are the "best targets". (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Research on reverse knowledge transfer (RKT) has relegated subsidiary age to a control variable. However, to the extent that subsidiary age captures experience with host countries and internal networks, it reflects accumulated knowledge stocks and capabilities. We draw on organizational ecology theory to theorize that subsidiary age is an important determinant of parent company benefits from RKT and that RKT from older subsidiaries is viewed as more beneficial to the parent company than RKT from younger subsidiaries. This relationship is negatively moderated by the use of acquisitions and majority-owned joint ventures, and positively moderated by the use of socialization mechanisms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB The adoption of the Internet has been widespread across countries, making much more information available and thus facilitating knowledge diffusion among businesses to boost their innovation performance. However, differences in firms' capabilities to use this newly available knowledge could create a new "digital divide" instead. Using 50,013 firm observations covering 117 developing and emerging countries over the 2006-11 period, this paper tests for knowledge spillover effects from industries' adoption of the Internet on firms' productivity and innovation performance. We test for heterogeneous spillover impacts on groups of firms that are commonly less engaged in innovation and on films with different productivity levels. Our specification regresses firm productivity and innovation performance - i.e., their investment in equipment and ownership of quality certificates and patents on industries' use of the Internet. Spillover effects are identified by controlling for firms' own investment in Internet technology, industry and country-year fixed effects as well as extensive firm-level controls. Our results show that industries' use of the Internet positively affects the average firm's productivity and its investment in equipment. We also identify modest impacts of industries' use of the Internet on the likelihood that firms obtain quality certificates and patents. On average, we find that the returns to productivity are larger for firms that commonly engage less in innovation, including single-plant establishments, non-exporters, and firms located in small agglomerations. However, results from quantile regressions show that only the most productive firms reap productivity gains from Internet-enabled knowledge access. Firms with productivity levels below the 50th percentile do not benefit much. The spillover effects from industries' adoption of the Internet identified in our work justify public policies aimed at fostering industries' use of the Internet. However, since we show that only firms with adequate absorptive capabilities benefit from the widespread Internet adoption, policy support should also focus on facilitating firms' access to networks and strengthening their capacities to use them.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyse the prerequisites for lateral knowledge transfer in manufacturing networks.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data stem from a single case study involving 26 interviews at the management level of a manufacturing network and a survey of 17 manufacturing plants in the network.
   Findings - The requirements for lateral knowledge transfer between knowledge-sending and knowledge-receiving plants are similar strategic orientation, product portfolio similarity and process similarity. If the knowledge-sending and knowledge-receiving plants meet at least one of these requirements, then knowledge transfer is facilitated. Plant age, functional ties and geographical proximity do not seem to be important in lateral knowledge transfer.
   Research limitations/implications - The results come from a single case study, limiting their generalisability. Further research should consider the influence of the network's coordination mechanism on lateral knowledge transfer.
   Originality/value - The paper investigates prerequisites for lateral knowledge transfer in manufacturing networks, shedding light on the fundamental factors that must be in place at the knowledge-sending and knowledge-receiving plants.

AB This research paper tries to analyse the role that knowledge about foreign markets has in increasing firms' exports in clustered spaces. We consider two interrelated sources of this knowledge, a firm's direct experience and its indirect experience from other clustered firms. In particular, it is proposed that firms can improve their export performance by accessing others' knowledge as long as they have some previous direct experience that allows them to identify, understand and exploit these. Nevertheless, this positive influence of previous direct experience on exports continues only to a certain point, at which time it becomes less relevant or even negative. Firms with broad international experience have little to learn from local interactions, being more enriching establishing relationships with agents from outside the cluster. Empirical evidence gathered from wine producers located in La Rioja, Spain, confirms the moderating but decreasing importance of previous experience.

AB Knowledge-based and network-based activities are known determinants of foreign subsidiary influence. We demonstrate that the interaction between these factors is essential in understanding how subsidiaries gain influence within an MNC. We test this using data on 184 foreign-owned subsidiaries in the UK. The results indicate that the possession of strategic resources (knowledge or embedded relations) increases subsidiary influence only when the knowledge is transferred back to headquarters. Importantly, the impact of subsidiary headquarters embeddedness, external embeddedness and knowledge development on influence is mediated by the extent of reverse knowledge transfer. This mediating role sheds new light on the antecedents to subsidiary influence. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.. All rights reserved.

AB Research Summary Firms in technology-based settings continuously mobilize the knowledge of individuals in the firm to execute new opportunities arising over time. Yet we have only a limited understanding of how individual-level knowledge aggregates to shape firm-level innovation. We use a computational model to develop a microfoundational theory of firm-level innovation that captures both intra-firm knowledge mobilization and inter-firm competition. A key insight is that despite intuitions that knowledge mobilization should protect against rival imitation, knowledge mobilization can often benefit rivals more than the focal firm itself, due to a process of continuous knowledge spillover-sharing among rivals. In addition, while knowledge-based advantages are often thought to be temporary without some isolating mechanism, sustainable advantage may emerge under limited conditions under which knowledge-mobilizing firms outrace rivals' imitation efforts. Managerial summary Managers in fast-moving technology-based industries innovate by mobilizing the knowledge of individuals in their firm to execute new market opportunities arising over time. A central challenge in such settings is that competitors may imitate this knowledge, thereby diminishing the advantages to the focal firm that derive from its innovations. We highlight the conditions under which such efforts at mobilizing individual knowledge within a firm can backfire and thus accelerate imitation as a result of knowledge spillover-sharing among the firm's industry rivals. To protect themselves, innovative firms in highly complex industries can use a recombination process to outrace their imitating rivals and generate sustainable advantages.

AB Purpose In recent years the role of business incubators (BIs) within the small-medium enterprise (SME) dimension has grown fast, supporting SMEs, especially during the early stage. For these reasons, this paper aims to investigate how BI supports entrepreneurs in the early stage and what specific instruments are used? What kinds of relations do start-ups use (RQ2)? Finally, the authors intend to explore the long-term influence of these relationships on the economic value of the start-ups (RQ3)? Design/methodology/approach The present paper is supported by a qualitative methodology of a single case study. To reach the declared goal in terms of relationship observation, the paper applies the CAOS model (Paoloni, 2021), an interpretative model useful for analysing the relational capital within the SME dimension. Findings This first explanatory research confirms the crucial role of the BI in the firm's development process. Especially in the early stage, the knowledge transfer from the BI allows the start-up to overcome its main difficulties: the organizational aspect and finance capacity. Research limitations/implications The limitation concerns the number of start-ups observed. Future lines of research will be focused on the study of other firms to acquire more data on the topic of BI programmes and start-ups. Practical implications The managerial implication refers to advancing knowledge and practice in the area of knowledge sharing actuated by BIs. The present work underlines the importance of relational capital as an intangible asset in the development of the younger company. Originality/value This paper contributes to two different fields: knowledge sharing by relational capital and gender studies.

AB This paper analyses the geographical proximity impact and the proximity paradox in a regional study of the Spanish agri-food industry. This study is mainly based on the Community Innovation Survey database, from which we get a representative group of agri-food companies in Murcia, Spain. The regional character of this research allows us to discount the institutional effects which could cause differences between companies in different regions. In addition, we consider individual innovative actors and alternative innovation outcomes. Our findings corroborate the significant impact of geographical proximity for the innovation in agri-food companies. We get differences between innovators when the geographical impact on absorptive capacities and innovation is examined: geographical proximity between agri-food companies and industrial states and R&D centres has a significant impact on firms' absorptive capacities whereas geographical distance to large companies and transport facilities play an important role in determining R&D activities. Our results corroborate the proximity paradox for the geographical dimension finding a non-linear relationship for the absorptive capacity in agri-food companies.

AB Based on the theory of acoustic waves, a circular surface radiator model is introduced as a basis for constructing a knowledge transfer model for a knowledge alliance. The three main variables in the model are chosen to be the number of enterprises in knowledge alliance, the frequency of knowledge transfer, and the relationship distances between the knowledge bodies. The internal mechanism of knowledge transfer in a knowledge alliance is studied, and the direct relationships among the internal influencing factors are explored. The results show that the number of enterprises in knowledge alliance, knowledge transfer frequency, and knowledge transfer effect are positively correlated. The "Rayleigh distance" in the knowledge field is the appropriate relationship distance measure for assessing knowledge transfer within the alliance. The Rayleigh distance is highly correlated with the number of enterprises in knowledge alliance and knowledge transfer frequency. Moreover, the number of enterprises in knowledge alliance and knowledge transfer frequency are interrelated.

   Design/methodology/approach - The conceptual framework is informed by empirical research based on a longitudinal multi-case study.
   Findings - This research identifies a nexus linking IMO with value creation in inter-firm partnerships. The findings also suggest that IMO has an impact on companies' performance in terms of knowledge transfer, innovation and market access.
   Research limitations/implications - IMO contributes to value creation processes in the context of strategic networks.
   Originality/value - A discussion of these findings, together with implications for practice and proposals for further research, is provided.

AB Faster knowledge attainment within organizations leads to improved innovation, and therefore competitive advantage. Interventions on the organizational network may be risky or costly or time-demanding. We investigate several communication policies in knowledge networks, which reduce the knowledge attainment time without interventions. We examine the resulting knowledge dynamics for real organizational networks, as well as for artificial networks. More specifically, we investigate the dependence of knowledge dynamics on: (1) the Selection Rule of agents for knowledge acquisition, and (2) the Order of implementation of "Selection" and "Filtering". Significant decrease of the knowledge attainment time (up to 74%) can be achieved by: (1) selecting agents of both high knowledge level and high knowledge transfer efficiency, and (2) implementing "Selection" after "Filtering" in contrast to the converse, implicitly assumed, conventional prioritization. The Non-Commutativity of "Selection" and "Filtering", reveals a Non-Boolean Logic of the Network Operations. The results demonstrate that significant improvement of knowledge dynamics can be achieved by implementing "fruitful" communication policies, by raising the awareness of agents, without any intervention on the network structure.

AB Purpose - Through increasing globalization, cities are becoming increasingly interconnected with each other. To remain competitive, it is necessary for cities to combine complementary non-local sources of knowledge with local knowledge sources. The authors contend that an increase in non-local knowledge sourcing tends to enhance local knowledge sourcing too. The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of international knowledge sources on the capacity to build upon local knowledge sources in a city region. In addition, the authors investigate whether information and communication technologies (ICT) knowledge sources have a bigger impact than do other fields of knowledge on local knowledge connectivity.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using the US Patent and Trademark Office data, the authors study knowledge sourcing trends for the years 1980-2016 across 33 global cities. Backward patent citations from these granted patents are used to identify the location of inventors of prior knowledge sources, and the geography of knowledge building connections over time is assessed by using the inventor locations of cited (source) and citing (recipient) patents.
   Findings - The authors show that international knowledge sourcing is highly connected with local knowledge sourcing. The authors also find that ICT have a significant effect on this relationship. However, there are significant differences across cities in the extent and nature of this relationship.
   Originality/value - This study contributes to the literature on the changing geography of knowledge connections. It provides a detailed picture of changing knowledge sourcing trends at a city region level, and it improves our understanding of the role played by a variety of knowledge connections in helping a city remain competitive.

AB Innovation output is key to the long run business success in high-technology markets. Since research is costly, the absorption of external knowledge might be a powerful device for improving innovation processes. Considering four high-technology sectors in Europe, we examine to what extent local networking, competitive spillovers, or (unobserved) locational advantages influence innovation processes at the firm level. Since high-technology markets require strong innovative capacity, we specifically investigate the effectiveness of patent blocking as a promising strategy to exclude competition and to improve own competitiveness. We model innovation processes empirically by means of a recent Bayesian stochastic frontier approach that allows for spatial dependence and spillover effects. Our results indicate that growing pressures to innovate could create vicious levels of innovation competition. Moreover, the access to local networks boosts the pursuit of innovation and enhances innovativeness.

AB We show that contacts in formal, informal and especially multiplex networks explain transfer of innovative knowledge in an organization. The contribution of informal contacts has been much acknowledged, while that of formal contacts did not receive much attention in the literature in recent decades. No study thus far has included both these different kinds of contacts in a firm, let alone considered their combined effect. The exact overlap between formal as well as informal contacts between individuals, forming multiplex or what we call rich ties because of their contribution, especially drives the transfer of new, innovative knowledge in a firm. Studying two cases in very different settings suggests these rich ties have a particularly strong effect on knowledge transfer in an organization, even when controlling for the strength of ties. Some of the effects on knowledge transfer in an organization previously ascribed to either the formal network or the informal network may actually be due to their combined effect in a rich tie.

AB We analyze the discovery of giant magneto-resistance (GMR) and its development and commercialization by the global disk drive industry to answer the question of "Who captures the benefits from innovation in a global innovation system?" We assess the returns to the scientists, firms, and countries associated with GMR. We find that the French and German scientists that discovered GMR and their labs benefited by receiving the Nobel Prize and small licensing fees. The firm that first commercialized the technology, IBM, captured profits from selling hard disk drives and magnetic heads using GMR. Other hard disk drive and head manufacturers based in the U.S. and Japan were able to quickly assimilate the technology and catch up with IBM. France and Germany reaped limited returns due to the lack of domestic firms with the absorptive capacity to commercialize GMR. The U.S. and Japan benefited from the success of their firms in commercializing GMR, as did other countries which were part of the global value chains of those companies. Consumers and firms that incorporated hard drives in their products ultimately benefited from cheaper hard drives with greater capacity. These findings illustrate the importance of absorptive capacity at the firm and national level in capturing benefits from innovation. They also show that the benefits to first mover firms can be short-lived in a competitive industry with open transfer of knowledge and limited appropriability regimes. Finally, they show that the location of jobs and wages associated with innovative products depends on the structure of the global value chains of leading firms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB A firm's ability to acquire and exploit external knowledge is often critical to achieving and sustaining a competitive advantage. In this study, we adopt a multi-dimensional view of absorptive capacity and focus specifically on the application of external knowledge that has been obtained via university-firm collaborations. We examine various organizational conditions that we propose influence a firm's ability to apply external knowledge for explorative and exploitative innovations. We collected data by a survey of firms in industries that frequently work with university research centres (URCs) and from publicly available sources. Results show that predictors of exploration and exploitation of the application of external knowledge differ. Surprisingly, technological relatedness, a common measure of absorptive capacity, is negatively associated with the application of external knowledge to explorative innovations, indicating that knowledge from more distant sources is applied more to exploration. Results also indicate that the effects of two external learning capabilities (prior experience with URCs and technological capability) on knowledge application are moderated in such a way by the tacitness of the knowledge transferred that experience is a stronger predictor when the knowledge is more explicit and technological capability is a stronger predictor when the knowledge is more tacit. We discuss the implications of these findings for research on the application of external knowledge.

AB Technology transfer has become a vital pipeline for acquiring external knowledge. The purpose of this paper is to portray the spatial dynamics of intercity technology transfer networks in China's three urban agglomerations based on patent right transaction data from 2008 to 2015. The integration of social networks and spatial visualization is used to explore spatial networks and influencing variables of the networks. The results demonstrate that Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen are emerging as hubs in the three urban agglomerations. The spatial distributions of degree and weighted degree are significantly heterogeneous and hierarchical. The larger cities play the role of a knowledge and technology incubator, highly related to their economic scale, research and development (R&D) input, and innovation output. The evolution of intercity technology linkages is driven by the networking mechanisms of preferential attachment, hierarchical and contagious diffusion, path dependence, and path breaking. Moreover, we found that the geographical proximity and technology gaps are determinants of the strength of intercity technology linkages. As a result, it has been discovered that the network in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei agglomeration is organized in a tree network, while the Yangtze River Delta features a polycentric network and the Pearl River Delta has multi-star characteristics.

AB Our paper sets out to explore the contingent institutional conditions that underpin knowledge transfer, and particularly commercialisation, from universities to enterprises across national borders. We explore the phenomenon in four technology-focused and research leading (in the national context) universities in Estonia, India, Portugal and the UK. We argue that participants in interactions (despite the fact that they maintain their core operations in different institutional fields) possess common knowledge bases, and shared norms and cognitive frameworks. In many cases however, the emergence of organisational rules to facilitate interactions do not lead to the institutionalisation of the processes at work: restricting the scope of both existing interactions and their advancement and offering a central role to nonpracticing entities. The paper advances university-led pooling of intellectual property (geographically or sectorally) as an alternative for institutionalisation.

We combine the Fuzzy Delphi Method, Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory and analytic network process to demonstrate the interactions and relations among critical criteria by using data from 20 Taiwanese restaurant entrepreneurs obtained in 2015-2017. The positive effects of human capital, market orientation, entrepreneurial orientation and absorptive capacity on innovation performance are confirmed. These findings advance resource-based scholarship and highlight the value of understanding the relationship between a restaurant's tangible and intangible resources for hospitality development.

AB Knowledge sharing sometimes plays a key role in the performance of clustered organizations, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), however, SMEs also face significant knowledge-related disadvantages due to their lack of absorptive capacity and functional expertise. This study investigates the influence of technical specialists on knowledge flow in a wine cluster in Australia. The main contribution of this paper is a finding that the technical specialist's gatekeeping role both links clustered SMEs to the global wine "systemworld" by transferring knowledge of technical developments and innovation, and simultaneously develops and refines regional winemaking styles by sharing locally specific, experientially derived knowledge. Technical specialists drew on bridging and bonding social capital to identify and retrieve specialist knowledge, and were capable of assimilating complex technical knowledge into the cluster. These findings are particularly significant because recipients were typically small and micro-firms, which are frequently located outside cluster knowledge-network.

AB This study seeks to understand the influence of specific investments (SIs) to cooperative innovation performance (CIP) by examining the mediating roles of knowledge transfer (KT) and governance mechanisms (GMs), including formal contracts (FCs) and relational trust (RT). A sample of 238 projects is used to test the proposed model through structural equation modelling. The results show SIs act indirectly through RT to influence CIP. KT plays a mediating role between the two GMs and CIP. Moreover, the results suggest that the mediating effect of KT between FCs and performance is full; however its effect between RT and performance is only partial, and the mediating effect of RT between SIs and performance is also partial.

AB The authors begin with an elaboration of a new theoretical concept: "relational fit", which consists of social capital and knowledge relatedness. They continue with an empirical analysis of the influence that "relational fit" between German corporate venture capital units (CVCs) and their innovative portfolio companies (PCs) has on knowledge transfer and knowledge creation in the CVC-PC dyad and subsequently on the PC's organizational performance. PC success is found to have dual significance for the corporation: high returns for the CVC unit and strategic potential for radical innovation. Integrating two hitherto neglected aspects of social capital - "conative fit" and "affective fit" - into their framework of "relational fit" the authors extend social capital theory. By combining the latter with the knowledge-based view of the firm they thereby demonstrate the interrelatedness and combined importance of the two concepts. Hence, "relational fit," proves to facilitate knowledge transfer and creation, which enhance organizational performance. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Research on intrafirm knowledge transfer has generally found a positive impact of knowledge inflows on the innovation of an organizational unit. However, the role of knowledge outflows during knowledge transfer is less clear. This paper argues that knowledge outflows influence innovation through a self- learning mechanism and a fairness assessment mechanism, and play a unique and important role on team innovation. Based on this new understanding on knowledge outflows, it is necessary to examine the impacts of inflows and outflows simultaneously in innovation research. This paper expresses the sum and difference of knowledge inflows and outflows as total and balanced knowledge flows. A theoretical model is proposed to examine the distinct and synergistic effects of total and balanced knowledge flows on employees' innovative behavior of an organizational unit. The model was tested on 148 retail units of an apparel firm based on survey responses from both shop managers and staff. Results showed that total and balanced flows have independent direct effects and a synergistic effect on employee innovative behavior: employees of a unit had the highest levels of innovative behavior when knowledge flows were high and balanced at the same time. This paper contributes to the literature by taking into account both the direction and magnitude of knowledge transfer to examine team innovation.

AB We examine how emerging country business groups overcome various technological constraints and succeed in enhancing their performance. Our theoretical contribution lies in showing how the ability of a business unit to benefit from intra-group technology transfer depends on the idiosyncratic manner in which the group geographically configures its network of units. The findings reveal that the geographic dispersion and concentration of the units of a group alter both the ability and willingness of its business units to transfer technologies to (or receive technologies from) other units and subsequently result in different performance outcomes. The location of a business unit also determines whether or not a unit competes with other fellow units and, consequently, influences how much a unit benefits from the technologies held by the group.

AB A first aim of this paper is to discuss the problem of vertical competition between suppliers of knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS) and their customers. The problem stems from the fact that the former transfer knowledge to the latter, thereby placing the latter in a position to produce the previously-purchased services by themselves (the KIBS paradox). A second aim is to demonstrate how KIBS deal with this problem. A literature review provides the elements we need to identify the competitive issue that these organisations face. Then we try to explain how KIBS deal with this issue, drawing on two theoretical approaches: (i) Burt's social structural theory of competition; and (ii) the concepts developed in the knowledge management literature relating to intra-and inter-organisational knowledge processes. The results of this theoretical work provide an avenue for further research on KIBS and relevant implications for practitioners.

AB Knowledge-which is closely linked to firm innovativeness-is accessed across organizational boundaries and geographic space via networks operating at different levels of analysis. However, we know tantalizingly little about the comparative influence of geography on knowledge flow across organizational boundaries over different types of ties, despite warnings that research needs to account for the geographic context of ties to fully understand causal relationships. Using a combination of primary and secondary data on 77 Canadian mutual fund companies, we find that institutional-level ties are valuable in knowledge transmission only when such ties are geographically proximate. Organization-level ties fail to act as transmitters of knowledge, regardless of geographic location. Interestingly, we find that geographically distant individual-level friendship ties are superior conduits for knowledge flow, which suggests they span "geographic holes.".

AB This study seeks to systematically investigate the contribution of social capital to individual performance. We conceptualized social capital along three dimensions (structural, relational and contextual) and examined the relationships between social capital along these dimensions and two types of performance (managerial and innovative), using data collected from the strategic product development departments of six large Korean manufacturing firms. As expected, we found a significant relationship between the centrality of a network and individual performance. When network centrality was decomposed into three types (advice centrality, influence centrality and idea centrality), however, the relative strength of each type changed significantly based on performance type. We also found that the number of weak ties had a significant positive effect both on innovative and managerial performance. When considered together with network centrality and absorptive capacity, however, weak ties turned out to be nonsignificant as predictors of managerial performance, but the strongest predictors of innovative performance. In contrast, absorptive capacity had a positive effect on both types of individual performance, while its strength as a determinant of individual performance was weaker than that of network centrality and weak ties.

AB The article initially addresses the concept of familiness and its connection with the succession process in the family firm to emphasize the relevance of the successor's knowledge. Then, a model is presented that evolves from a dyadic relationship in the knowledge transfer process from predecessor to successor to a network of exchanges with multiple agents and sources that enhance the successor's construction of knowledge through time. Key aspects derived from that model about the successor's human capital, the predecessor's role, the knowledge network, the relational context, and the time dimension of the process are then discussed.

AB This study considers the government-sponsored R&D Consortia as a critical external learning alternative to upgrade technology capabilities of small and medium enterprises. The study hypothesizes that the participating firms in a government-sponsored R&D alliance can improve their technology transfer performance if they can sustain appropriate network relationships with other network members, such as the research institute or other alliance firms. In addition, we demonstrate that the learning intent and absorptive capability of participating firms moderate the effects of network embeddedness on performance. The study uses a sample of 110 companies from the R&D Consortia sponsored by the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), a primary R&D center founded in 1973 and supported by government for industry in Taiwan. The results conclude with significant impacts of network embeddedness on technology transfer performance and significant moderating effects of organizational learning. The "transferred to whom" issue in the differentiated network of R&D consortia is also examined and discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cooperative knowledge creation among enterprises is becoming increasingly common in uncertain environments with rapidly changing technology and increasingly complex network relationships. The objective of this paper is to better understand why and how an uncertain network environment affects an enterprise's knowledge creation performance and knowledge creation decision-making based on a dynamic knowledge supernetwork. Regarding the methodology, we proposed a dynamic knowledge supernetwork model that contains an enterprise subnetwork and a knowledge subnetwork, constructed the knowledge creation and knowledge diffusion mechanisms, and simulated the process of knowledge creation and diffusion through a multi-agent simulation. Moreover, we utilized the empirical patent data of power technology to prove the rationality and effectiveness of our model and simulation results. The results involve three main aspects. First, knowledge performance shows an exponential growth pattern. Second, in the dynamic network, we obtain a U-shaped relationship only when the effort needed to establish new cooperation is relatively small, and the inverted U-shaped relationship disappears when the above parameter exceeds a certain threshold. Third, the knowledge-based cooperation strategy is superior to the network-based cooperation strategy, and knowledge performance increases linearly and decreases exponentially with increasing network dynamics when the effort needed to establish new cooperation does not exceed and exceeds the threshold, respectively.

AB Manufacturing plants operating within the international manufacturing network (IMN) of a multinational company (MNC) frequently participate in the intra-company creation and distribution of knowledge, thereby contributing to the competitive advantage of the whole company and at the same time strengthening their own position within the MNC. International business and operations management literature suggests that plants taking up a knowledge-sending role within their IMN have a stronger position within the company. Nevertheless, literature offers little guidance on how to become a knowledge disseminator within the IMN.
   This article proposes to fill an important gap in the literature related to the concept of disseminative capacity, aiming (1) to explore how the knowledge-sending and knowledge-receiving roles of manufacturing plants can be assessed in an IMN context, and (2) to identify the capabilities needed for a plant to become a knowledge-sending unit within the IMN. To reach this objective, thirteen case studies were analyzed involving plants in four different countries.
   Results from the case studies show that (1) manufacturing plants can be positioned along a continuum from predominantly knowledge-receiving to predominantly knowledge-sending units, with multiple intermediary positions coexisting; (2) several plants have a strategic intent to change their positions, moving mainly along this continuum towards a higher intensity of knowledge-sending roles; (3) three elements are identified as necessary preconditions to develop disseminative capabilities, namely a knowledge-sharing-oriented organizational culture, incentive systems and organizational structures that reward knowledge sharing, and the intensity of inter-plant human interactions.

AB In this paper, we address the issue of translation behaviour in the context of a service multinational. Our case study of a Nordic bank shows that emergent translation needs may be handled by the organisation and the individual in various ways such as self-translation, technical translation tools, social networks, or the central translation department. The choice between these options is shaped by situational influences including growing language diversity, accuracy, response speed, cost considerations, confidentiality of the information and task criticality. A key finding is the importance of social networks as a coping mechanism for employees confronted with the need to provide timely translation solutions, including the resort to external social networks, even relatives. Rather than a seemingly mundane, peripheral activity, translation was found to play a role in service delivery, organisational functioning and hence company performance. We propose a multilevel theoretical model of the translation process and conclude that organisation's translation ability which consists of organisational and individual responses should be considered as a component of its language absorptive capacity.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze aspects of a network structure that promotes the practice of the knowledge management (KM) process in a service organization. The idea that knowledge is the main organizational resource has established itself in recent years, and knowledge has become more valuable in service organizations. Managing knowledge is therefore a central activity for organizations, and organizational structure must assist in this process.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research strategy used is the simple case study, applied in a large multinational company in its unit established in Brazil.
   Findings - The paper points out that the network structure has more flexible characteristics regarding formalization, centralization and integration. In the case study, this structure encourages the flow of knowledge through the interaction between individuals, and also across sectors of the organization, with the aid of a department coordinating the KM process, responsible for the storage and distribution of the best practices for future use in sites of service.
   Research limitations/implications - The first point that should be highlighted is that the organization selected for the study is highly advanced in terms of KM, producing excessively positive results. Another negative aspect is related to the single case methodology. It does not allow extrapolation of the results to a larger population.
   Practical implications - Within the context of industrial services highlights the service provider sites. The sites correspond to the service provider company frontline. In the sites occur the process of providing service, contact with the customer, improvement activities and, essentially, where knowledge is put in practice. To facilitate the storage and distribution of knowledge, the network structure presents a sector called Center of Excellence. The Center of Excellence aims to centralize the repository of knowledge, enabling the transfer of knowledge between different sites.
   Originality/value - The main contribution is aimed at describing the characteristics of a network structure that stimulates the KM process in a service organization. This network of sites facilitates the flow of knowledge and the creative process.

AB We explore heterogeneity in the formation of new ventures within regions using agent-based simulation methodology. The study draws on entrepreneurial knowledge and action literature to examine the roles of knowledge acquisition and transformation in regional sustainability of new venture formation. A model of new venture growth pitted against incumbent firm innovation is tested on configurations of regional knowledge landscapes. Results of this analysis suggest that competing entrepreneurship perspectives of knowledge spillover and network-based new venture formation coexist and even interact. Formal knowledge acquisition and knowledge arbitrage are more effective formation mechanisms in knowledge-scarce regions, while informal knowledge acquisition and serendipity produce the highest levels of new venture formation in knowledge-rich regions. New ventures with smaller networks tend to exhibit higher likelihood of formation than those with larger networks. Formal knowledge acquisition and arbitrage not only improve survival early in the evolution of regions, but also create the basis for informal, serendipitous knowledge appropriation's superior influence on sustainable entrepreneurship. These results provide a platform for future research regarding theoretical perspectives on new venture formation, suggest growth strategies to entrepreneurs, and offer guidance to policymakers and economic development professionals who strive to increase the entrepreneurial activity of their regions or countries.

AB The aim of this study is to investigate the value-adding role of corporate monitoring and corporate involvement in 'sticky' inter-subsidiary innovation transfer environments. The value added role of these two managerial approaches is viewed in terms of their impact on innovation transfer efficiency and effectiveness. Based on the network view of the MNC, our research builds on the notion that the corporate headquarters (CHQ) is ill-informed and may suffer from a radical uncertainty about what it actually knows and needs to know. By using a data sample containing 87 innovation transfer projects in 25 multinational companies, we test six sets of hypotheses. Overall, our findings show that the value added of CHQ monitoring as well as an active CHQ involvement is considerably constrained. However, contrary to our expectations, the results show that CHQ monitoring gives rise to an increase in both transfer efficiency and effectiveness when the 'stickiness' is based on tangible resource constraints. The results imply that when it comes to CHQ involvement during the innovation transfer processes, the choice between a hands-off and a hands-on approach has to be understood in the light of the CHQ's knowledge situation.

AB Research collaboration has long been suggested as an effective way to obtain innovative outcomes. Nevertheless, relatively little is known about whether and how different research collaboration strategies inspire or inhibit firms in the exploration of new knowledge. Drawing upon the research collaboration literature and social network theory, this study examines the effects of two specific collaboration strategies (i.e., collaborating widely and collaborating deeply) on new knowledge exploration by recognizing the moderating roles of the local and global cohesion of knowledge networks. We test our hypotheses by using a manually collected sample of 730 Chinese vehicle or parts manufacturers during the period between 1985 and 2011. The empirical results suggest the positive effects of research collaboration breadth and collaboration depth on new knowledge exploration and that the global cohesion of intra-organizational knowledge networks magnifies the effect of collaboration breadth, while local cohesion negatively moderates the effect of collaboration depth on new knowledge exploration. These findings jointly indicate that a research collaboration strategy in combination with the structure of a knowledge base is crucial for obtaining novel knowledge.

AB Strategic alliances have become popular organizational forms in the last two decades. Prior research suggests alliances promote knowledge sharing between the partners. In this research, using patent data, we study the impact of information technology (IT) intensity on knowledge flows in alliances. Research has shown that prealliance knowledge stocks of the partners facilitate knowledge flows to the focal firm. We find that knowledge flows to the focal firm are enhanced when the focal firm and its partner have high IT intensity. We find support for our theorizing that IT is a necessary complementary resource that facilitates knowledge flows among partners in alliances.

AB The literature on "open innovation" so far focuses almost exclusively on strategic issues. In this largely conceptual paper we propose behavioral foundations for knowledge exchange and knowledge sharing to address this gap in the literature. Innovation and knowledge development that result from knowledge transfer, is an uncertain and cumulative process that typically involves a number of parties. Knowledge transfer between people and firms has been fruitfully studied from a structural or network perspective. The social network literature however, faces an "action problem". Focusing on structural elements such as an agent's position in a network and the types of relations entertained cannot explain why actors actually do share knowledge. The exchange of knowledge is elusive and is a discretionary act for the people involved, certainly in the case of open innovation (OI). It is argued here that social network analysis is to be complemented by the concept of gift exchange, drawing on social exchange literature. Gift exchange - following Mauss' dictum to "give, receive and reciprocate"- establishes obligations between people especially under circumstances of ambiguity, which explain why and how knowledge exchange relations are established, persist, and may also end. Relationships in a social network and the social capital that inheres in these cannot be drawn on at will to exchange knowledge. These obligations established by gift exchange between individuals who share a connection explain why agents exchange knowledge with each other even in the absence of markets or hierarchy.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to focus on the interaction process between organizations of a knowledge network as a means to promote learning. In particular, the authors aim to answer the following research questions: how do dyadic and network relationships contribute to inter-organizational creation and transfer of knowledge? More specifically, which joint activities between organizations facilitate inter-organizational learning within a knowledge network? That is, the authors are interested in the relationship processes for inter-organisational learning, aiming to identify and understand the joint activities through which organizations within an institutional network generate and transfer knowledge.
   Design/methodology/approach - Aiming at studying how six institutional actors generate and transfer knowledge, the existing dyadic relationships between a focal actor (a technological center of the textile and clothing industry - CITEVE) and each one of the other five institutional actors were studied. In the study of this knowledge network the authors analyzed several documental sources and carried out 19 interviews.
   Findings - This study shows how dyadic and network relationships contribute to inter-organisational creation and transfer of knowledge. It assesses several joint activities through which organizations in the studied network learn with each other and compares the five dyadic relationships in terms of their distinctive features. Through the cooperative effort based on joint activities between actors, the studied network generates complementary and multidisciplinary knowledge aiming to promote network learning of the studied organizations. Management implications and suggestions for further research on network learning are discussed.
   Originality/value - This paper adds to the literature on network learning and management by empirically illustrating how a network of organizations in a given industry contributes to knowledge generation. It is an original contribution because, first, it allows a better understanding of how organizations of a knowledge network interact and contribute for network learning. In particular, the paper identifies a large number of joint activities for inter-organizational learning in the context of a traditional industry. Second, the research shows empirically how such interaction and learning occur in practice within a network context that comprises only institutional actors.

AB While a great deal of literature has paid attention to knowledge spillover on innovation, this study argues that geographical knowledge search that lays much emphasis on firm strategies merits more attention. This paper examines the effect of geographical knowledge search strategies, such as local/non-local search depth and local/non-local search breadth on product innovation. We reveal that while local search depth and breadth as well as non-local search breadth exert a significant influence, non-local search depth produces a negative impact on product innovation. Our research suggests that clustering firms' geographical knowledge search strategies and R&D intensity should be highlighted to understand their product innovation.

AB This paper analyzes whether belonging to a business group enhances firms' propensity for and intensity of R&D based on the greater opportunities to finance and co-ordinate R&D strategies and internalize knowledge spillovers. Compared with the existing literature, this paper has the following novelties: (a) it examines how the organization and diversification of business groups influence the R&D investment of affiliated firms; (b) it analyzes the role of R&D spillovers among affiliated firms; and (c) it distinguishes between propensity for and intensity of R&D. We find that less diversified groups are more likely to centralize R&D, while in more diversified groups firms are more likely to be autonomous. We find that controlled companies are more likely to benefit from knowledge spillovers than firms at the head of the group. Finally, we find that R&D autonomy is significantly associated with both a higher propensity for and intensity of R&D in controlled companies.

AB Explanations of knowledge sharing in organizations emphasize either personality variables such as motivation or network-related structural variables such as centrality. Little empirical research examines how these two types of variables are in fact related: how do extrinsic and intrinsic motivation explain the position that an employee entertains in a knowledge sharing network within an organization? Much is to be gained from a better understanding of how, empirically, psychological variables and an organization's network interrelate (Burt et al., 1998; Kalish and Robins, 2006; Moch, 1980; Teigland and Wasko, 2009). Still, this line of enquiry is not pursued much (Foss et al., 2009). This paper integrates the structural characteristics known to be implicated in knowledge transfer typically focused on in the social network literature on the one hand, with the motivational perspective commonly identified in the organization literature. This study examines how motivation - extrinsic (expected organizational rewards, reciprocal benefits) and intrinsic (knowledge self-efficacy, enjoyment in helping others) - might explain how employees may be better connected in the full knowledge transfer network or might be engaged more in inter-unit knowledge transfer. Connectedness (closeness centrality) and inter-unit ties are well-known to contribute to knowledge transfer. Analyzing data from a survey at two large European organizations, this study, counterintuitively, shows that neither intrinsic nor extrinsic motivation explain an individual's favorable position in a knowledge transfer network.

AB This paper endeavors to enrich the existing knowledge acquisition literatures by specifically highlighting downsides of external ties of individuals. We introduce the concept of reverse knowledge diffusion (RKD) through external ties of individuals, and develop theoretical propositions to explain how the risks of RKD vary based on competitive dynamics and status of firms as innovation market leaders or market followers. We develop the construct of RKD to help explain why rivals may pursue contrasting knowledge seeking strategies with regards to leverage external ties of individuals, the timing of establishing these ties, and ex ante control mechanisms designed to regulate these relationships. We also discuss how our propositions advance the theory of knowledge seeking behaviors and generate future research opportunities.

AB Purpose This study aims to investigate the effects of open innovation (OI) and big data analytics (BDA) on reflective knowledge exchange (RKE) within the context of complex collaborative networks. Specifically, it considers the relationships between sourcing knowledge from an external environment, transferring knowledge to an external environment and adopting solutions that are useful to appropriate returns from innovation. Design/methodology/approach This study analyzes the connection between the number of patent applications and the amount of OI, as well as the association between the number of patent applications and the use of BDA. Data from firms in the 27 European Union countries were retrieved from the Eurostat database for the period 2014-2019 and were investigated using an ordinary least squares regression analysis. Findings Because of its twofold lens based on both knowledge management and OI, this study sheds light on OI collaboration modes and highlights the crucial role they could play in innovation. In particular, the results suggest that OI collaboration modes have a strong effect on innovation performance, stimulating the search for RKE. Originality/value This study furthers a deeper understanding of RKE, which is shown to be an important mechanism that incentivizes firms to increase their efforts in the innovation process. Further, RKE supports firms in taking full advantage of the innovative knowledge they generate within their inter-organizational network.

AB Academic research on knowledge transfer has focused on the United States, the highest technologies, elite US research universities, and, for the most part, has not considered the interactions between regional firms and low- and medium-technology industries-the industries that are most important in most countries and in Italy, in particular. This Special Issue on knowledge transfer by Italian universities consists of papers that show the multi-faceted roles that Italian universities have developed and, in particular, their strong regional focus. In this introduction, we explore the interplay between universities' involvement in knowledge transfer and local context and regional specificities. We discuss the variety of channels through which knowledge can flow and emphasize the mechanisms that universities have developed to interact with the lower technology, traditional industries that characterize the Italian economy. We explore the conundrum that Italian universities face as they must balance the competitive demands of academe to publish in international journals, while remaining engaged with local and regional businesses. The papers in this Special Issue examine the knowledge transfer efforts by universities in the very Italian different regions, which have their own different specific opportunities and needs for university engagement.

AB Collaboration with geographically distant partners may enhance a firm's innovative performance. In practice, however, this may be complicated as personal contacts are more limited so that effective search and transfer of remote partners' tacit knowledge is hampered. We tested the potential moderating role of R&D intensity which, by indicating technology-oriented absorptive capacity, may mitigate the problems associated with remote collaboration. Drawing on survey data of 248 high-tech small firms, we find that remote collaboration is positively related with innovation performance, but at low R&D intensity, the relationship vanishes.

SO LABOUR ECONOMICS

DE Wage dispersion; Labour mobility, Network; Knowledge transfer
ID WORKER; INVESTMENT; SEARCH
AB In this paper, we highlight knowledge as specific channel through which labour mobility affects conditional within-firm wage dispersion. We present a model in which workers acquire knowledge on the job and firms pursue a policy of learning-by-hiring. The latter generates workers flows that connect firms in a network. A firm's position in the network depends on its capacity to absorb the tacit knowledge developed by other firms in the economy. The model predicts that firms central to the network, those with the highest absorptive capacity of tacit knowledge, have the highest wage dispersion. Using 1995-2001 Veneto (a region of Italy) matched employer employee data, we map workers flows between firms and build the network formed by all the firms. For each firm, we assess its network centrality. In our data conditional within-firm wage dispersion turns out to be increasing in network centrality, confirming the prediction of the model.

AB Social interaction between managers from different units of a multinational enterprise (MNE) has been shown to be an important factor stimulating intra-MNE knowledge-sharing. Face-to-face social interactions form a communication channel particularly conducive to the transfer of tacit, non-codified knowledge. But intensive social interaction also provides opportunities for social construction of knowledge in a learning dialogue. The first explanation (sender-receiver) makes us expect social interaction to moderate positively the effects of the factors giving rise to knowledge flows in the first place, such as differences in capabilities between MNE subsidiaries. The second perspective (social learning) also grants an independent effect to social interaction as a main factor stimulating intra-MNE knowledge flows. We formulate hypotheses based on both perspectives, and test these on data from 169 MNE subsidiaries. Our findings show a considerable main effect of social interaction on all intra-MNE knowledge flows, confirming the expectations based on the social learning model. Interaction effects, based on the predictions of the sender-receiver model, are only partly confirmed. These findings suggest that future research should devote more attention to the social constitution of MNE knowledge. Journal of International Business Studies (2009) 40, 719-741.

AB Research on organizational knowledge transfer is burgeoning, and yet our understanding of its antecedents and consequences remains rather unclear. Although conceptual and qualitative reviews of the organizational knowledge transfer literature have emerged, no study has attempted to summarize previous quantitative empirical findings. As a first step towards that goal, we use meta-analytic techniques to examine how knowledge, organization and network level antecedents differentially impact organizational knowledge transfer. Additionally, we consolidate research on the relationship between knowledge transfer and its consequences. We also demonstrate how the intra- and inter-organizational context, the directionality of knowledge transfers, and measurement characteristics moderate the relationships studied. By aggregating and consolidating existing research, our study not only reveals new insights into the levers and outcomes of organizational knowledge transfer, but also provides meaningful directions for future research.

AB Most of the studies about industrial clusters and innovation stress the importance of firms' geographical proximity and their embeddedness in local business networks (BNs) as factors that positively affect their learning and innovation processes. More recently, scholars have started to claim that firm-specific characteristics should be considered to be central in the process of learning and innovation in clusters. This article contributes to this latter direction of research. It applies social network analysis to explore the structural properties of knowledge networks in three wine clusters in Italy and Chile. The results show that in spite of firms' geographical proximity and the pervasiveness of local BNs, in novation-related knowledge is diffused in clusters in a highly selective and uneven way. This pattern is found to be related to the heterogeneous and asymmetric distribution of firm knowledge bases in the clusters.

A conceptual model is developed by integrating organizational learning theory, relational governance and the resource-based view. Based on a cross-sectional sample of 160 firms in the information technology industry and a structural equation model, the findings show that learning intent, absorptive capacity and cross-cultural differences influence relationship learning. This study further addresses the moderating effects of trust. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Innovative technologies are reshaping the global economic landscape, by improving speed and ease of communications and interaction among the various economic actors involved in the productive cycle.
   In this paper, we discuss the role that technological learning and information and communication technologies (ICT) play in fostering entrepreneurial development in the Knowledge Economy and support our conceptual constructs with a series of case studies from developed, developing and transitioning economies.
   We compare and contrast entrepreneurial initiatives, policies and practices and the experience of ways and means to promote learning and entrepreneurship such as global/local (glocal), real-virtual incubator networks (G-RVIN) and other real and virtual infra-structures and infra-technologies (such as Innovation Networks and Knowledge Clusters or INKC) and derive lessons learned for policy makers, practitioners and entrepreneurs.

AB In this study we examined how the size of non-formal groups between organisation members affect the transfer of knowledge in the context of the efficiency and effectiveness of this process. To analyse the dynamics of the transfer of knowledge the cellular automata model was used. The model is based on local interactions between members of the organisation, that take place in the nearest neighbourhood. These groups of close neighbours are represented by von Neumann's neighbourhood (four nearest-neighbours) and Moore's neighbourhood (four nearest-neighbours and four next-nearest neighbours) and complex neighbourhood (four nearest neighbours, four next-nearest neighbours and four next-next-neighbours). The results of the simulation show the influence of the size of the neighbourhood on the efficiency of knowledge transfer.

AB Work on clusters during the last few decades convincingly demonstrates enhanced opportunities for local growth and entrepreneurship, but external upstream knowledge linkages are often overlooked or taken for granted. This article is an attempt to remedy this situation by investigating why and how young, single-site firms search for distant sources of complementary competences. The discussion is positioned within a comprehensive framework that allows a systematic investigation of the approaches available to firms engaged in globally extended learning. By utilizing the distinction between problem awareness (what remote knowledge is needed?) and source awareness (where does this knowledge reside?) the article explores the relative merits and inherent limitations of pipelines, listening posts, crowdsourcing and trade fairs to acquire knowledge and solutions from geographically and relationally remote sources.

AB Geographically dispersed reservoirs of knowledge represent significant opportunities for multinational enterprises (MNEs), both in terms of feeding the firm's innovation process, as well as adapting technology to new markets. They face serious challenges in accomplishing these tasks, due to the well-known barriers associated with the transfer of knowledge out of its local context. We argue that ethnic inventors might play a role in alleviating these challenges, by acting as a bridge between their countries of origin (CoO) and the MNE headquarters. Using USPTO data on internationally connected patents granted to US-based MNEs operating in knowledge-intensive industries over the period 1975-2009, our empirical exercise shows that patents involving ethnic inventors from a given CoO are associated with greater integration of knowledge originating from that CoO in the MNE innovation process. Further investigation indicates that this effect is probably limited to knowledge developed within the MNE's network, suggesting that ethnic ties - per se - might not be sufficiently powerful to overcome the joint barriers of national borders and organizational boundaries. Finally, our analysis reveals that ethnic inventors may also be associated with knowledge exploitation in their CoO. This mainly seems to occur in CoOs plagued by market-related institutional voids.

AB This paper investigates the relationship between foreign subsidiary competition and embeddedness in a peripheral area of an advanced country. The study argues that pressure to innovate and unintended private knowledge spillovers compete in explaining the relationship between competition and embeddedness as a result of the tension of information sharing. Such a tension can be relaxed when accounting for subsidiaries' competence-creating entry motives. Statistical analysis supports this argument. This study contributes to the broad IB field as well as to business network theory and to research on the creation of local linkages by MNEs. Implications for managers and policy-makers are also discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to offer deeper insight into the relationship between a subsidiary's internal integration in its manufacturing network and subsidiary-level operational performance by taking into account the country context of the respective subsidiary.
   Design/methodology/approach - Subsidiary-level information is gathered using the sixth round of the International Manufacturing Strategy Survey, thus including 507 subsidiaries from 22 countries. Country context is operationalised using the Global Competitiveness Report published by the World Economic Forum.
   Findings - The findings reveal that internal integration has a positive influence on operational performance improvement. Country context acts as a moderator on this relationship: subsidiaries in less developed countries are only able to improve their effectiveness (quality, flexibility, delivery), while developed country subsidiaries gain both effectiveness and efficiency (cost, time) benefits from internal integration.
   Research limitations/implications - The unit of analysis is the knowledge-receiving subsidiary without taking the characteristics of the sending unit or that of the whole network of subsidiaries into account. Based on the context-dependency of the integration-performance relationship found in this paper, a future research agenda is proposed including further factors (absorptive capacity, knowledge complementarity, organisational practices) that could influence this relationship.
   Practical implications - Subsidiary managers in less developed countries should strive to acquire intra-network knowledge related to effectiveness, while managers in developed countries can expect both efficiency and effectiveness benefits.
   Originality/value - A large-scale survey encompassing subsidiaries from both emerging and developed countries is used to offer deeper insight into the relationship between internal integration and performance. The paper provides a possible explanation for previous mixed findings on this relationship. The differentiation between efficiency and effectiveness performance shows that country context represents an important factor that moderates the integration-performance relationship.

AB Existing theories of international business and strategy do not fully explain how local knowledge disadvantage faced by foreign investors can be mitigated. We conducted an in-depth qualitative study into four MNCs to investigate the micro-processes of how they generated value from their dispersed sources of local knowledge in China. The results suggest an interactive model: that MNCs employed management processes encompassing three strategically interconnected efforts global knowledge penetration, local-global knowledge blending, and local-global knowledge integration. The model highlights the interplay between global and local knowledge and challenges extant research that solely focuses on the transfer of either home-based or local knowledge. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB Social network theory suggests that firms bridging structural holes by connecting disconnected partners in a network benefit from timely access to diverse knowledge. However, the existing literature reports mixed evidence with regard to the performance implications of this view. Our study examines how a firm's diverse knowledge base and knowledge-processing capabilities affect knowledge creation when a firm bridges multiple structural holes in an inter-firm network. The model is tested on a sample of 191 firms in high-technology industries. The dependent variable, knowledge creation, was measured by the number of patents generated. Results show that when a firm spans multiple structural holes, its diverse technological knowledge facilitates knowledge creation. However, when a firm already possesses well-developed knowledge acquisition capabilities, spanning structural holes reduces knowledge creation. This paper suggests that internal knowledge base and knowledge-processing capabilities determine the impacts of external network positions on firm knowledge creation. It provides implications on how a firm best capitalizes on external network positions.

AB We use an augmented version of the UK Innovation Surveys 4-7 to explore firm-level and local area openness externalities on firms' innovation performance. We find strong evidence of the value of external knowledge acquisition both through interactive collaboration and non-interactive contacts such as demonstration effects, copying or reverse engineering. Levels of knowledge search activity remain well below the private optimum, however, due perhaps to informational market failures. We also find strong positive externalities of openness resulting from the intensity of local interactive knowledge search a knowledge diffusion effect. However, there are strong negative externalities resulting from the intensity of local non-interactive knowledge search a competition effect. Our results provide support for local initiatives to support innovation partnering and counter illegal copying or counterfeiting. We find no significant relationship between either local labour quality or employment composition and innovative outputs. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Despite its economic relevance, only a few studies focus on knowledge creation, diffusion and utilisation in traditional industries located in peripheral regions, and even fewer on the innovation interdependencies between industries and regions. The theory of differentiated knowledge bases is capable to explain both the industrial and spatial patterns of the knowledge flows. The present study aims to reveal the process of innovation-related knowledge sourcing in the printing industry located in the peripheral region of Kecskemet, Hungary. The research builds on three main questions: what are the main sources of new knowledge? Who are the main collaborative partners in knowledge acquisition and transfer? And what is the main spatial level of knowledge sourcing? The results indicate that in a peripheral region, innovative firms build on the combination of direct and indirect knowledge sources mostly external to the region, while the non-innovative ones typically rely on local, incomplex knowledge sources.

AB Research summary: We study the processes through which multinational corporations (MNCs) identify and make use of external sources of knowledge. Based on a seven-year longitudinal study of one MNC's overseas scouting unit, we show how a simple one-directional "channelling" process gradually gave way to three higher value-added processes, labelled "translating," "matchmaking," and "transforming." Building on these insights, we develop an integrative framework, defining the conditions under which each of the four processes is likely to transpire, and showing how the stock of social capital held by the scouting unit allows it to perform increasingly high value-added activities over time. Implications for the MNC, external knowledge sourcing, and boundary-spanning literatures are discussed.
   Managerial summary: Over the years, many multinational corporations (MNCs) have created overseas "scouting" units to tap into new ideas and opportunities in leading-edge markets, but with mixed outcomes. In this study, we describe the development of a European telecom firm's scouting unit in Silicon Valley during the 2000s, focusing on the specific approaches used by the scouting managers to build effective connections between Silicon Valley start-ups and the firm's business units back in Europe. We identify four distinct approaches for different types of opportunities, and we observe a clear sequencing of effort over time as the scouting managers built the necessary capabilities and credibility.

AB Coopetition, i.e., cooperation between competing actors, has become a pervasive strategy for innovative firms. The primary focus of studies investigating coopetition centers on inter-firm relationships, highlighting the benefits, limits and configurational patterns of cooperative relationships between competing firms. Only a small, emerging group of studies seeks to extend the concept to the intra-firm level, stressing the existence and effects of competition and cooperation between units that are part of the same organization. This paper contributes to this latter group by investigating the effects of internal coopetition on knowledge and innovation sharing and highlighting the fundamental role of knowledge brokers in managing the resulting tensions. Based on a qualitative case study of the video game publisher Ubisoft, we stress how the tensions raised by internal coopetitive settings limit knowledge sharing between units, and we analyze the mechanisms through which the knowledge broker helps to overcome these limits. We identify three main functions of this knowledge broker that allow the promotion of knowledge and innovation transfer to occur between coopeting units: (1) protecting the unit's competitive advantage by introducing a lagging principle in the transfer process, (2) reducing sharing costs by standardizing innovative solutions, and (3) enhancing awareness of and trust in innovative solutions by centralizing knowledge diffusion.

AB This study explores academic research on technology transfer (TT) and the related themes. The TT field has attracted considerable scholarly attention in recent years and has grown rapidly, resulting in a large body of knowledge. Using a bibliometric approach, this study reviews related research issues as well as their influence and connections and provides directions for future research. It uses Clarivate Analytics' Web of Science database that includes 3218 bibliographic references. Several bibliometric analysis techniques and a subsequent review of the content of the most relevant documents are adopted. The performance analysis provided an updated overview of the evolution of the TT literature from 1969 to 2018 and quantitatively identified the most active and influential journals, articles, authors, and organizations. The co-authorship network analysis allowed us to identify and visualize the structure of relations between authors as well as determine the collaboration patterns among them. On the basis of the information supplied by the co-authorship network, the main literature was reviewed to identify the current status and research trends related to TT, identifying five main research streams and related topics. The implications of the study's findings and directions for future TT research are finally discussed to enhance our understanding of TT agents and issues and support further research in this field.

AB Firms use different structural arrangements to carry out their internal work, and interunit interactions that take place in the context of these arrangements may have different consequences for knowledge sharing. We explore four contexts of such interunit interaction-interunit meetings, project groups, cross-border teams, and expatriate/repatriate interactions-and we examine the extent to which they are associated with social capital and knowledge sharing. Data from structured interviews with multinational corporation (MNC) managers, which we explored using MANCOVA/ANCOVA and regression analysis, showed that cross-border and expatriate/repatriate interaction contexts are associated with more interpersonal trust and shared cognitive ground than interunit meeting and project group ones, and the expatriate/repatriate context with more shared cognitive ground than all other contexts. The regression results show a significant relationship between the cross-border team and expatriate/repatriate contexts and knowledge sharing. We also find that affective and cognitive social capital mediate the relationship between cross-border team and expatriate/repatriate contexts and knowledge sharing. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This paper explores the possibility that utilizing the firm's knowledge resources to complete important tasks can backfire and undermine competitive performance. Drawing on organizational capabilities and knowledge-sharing research, we develop a situated performance view that holds that the value of obtaining and using knowledge within a firm depends on the task situation. Using a data set of 182 sales proposals for client work in a management consulting company, we show that sales teams that had varying needs to learn and differentiate themselves from competitors derived different levels of value from obtaining and using electronic documents and advice from colleagues. Highly experienced teams were more likely than inexperienced teams to lose the sales bids if they utilized such knowledge. Teams that had a high need to differentiate themselves from competitors also had a lower chance of winning if they utilized electronic documents. There were situations, however, where teams performed better if they utilized the firm's knowledge resources. These results suggest that competitive performance depends not on how much firms know but on how they use what they know. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Sustainable economic growth is closely linked to synergy in a national system of innovation. Although the dynamic synergy mechanism of the triple helix relations is essential to technology innovation, there are limited research methodologies to study or estimate the synergy effect accurately. This paper introduces a new approach in non-linear complex systems theory to offer steps towards a possible solution to this conundrum. Based on the pattern formation of the Belousov-Zhabotinsky's reaction, the paper constructs a simulation equation to explore the evolution mechanism by comparing the ideal state with the current state in China. The research finds that (1) under the ideal balanced condition of industrial absorptive capacity and academic knowledge transfer capability, the stronger incentive policies would play much more important roles than weak policies; (2) the performance of collaborative innovation is not optimal under current situation in China, but the industrial absorptive capacity, especially in private enterprises, has exceeded the capability of knowledge transfer in academia, and it has become the main driving force to promote future innovation. If the innovation policy can be focused on the high-level balance between the knowledge network and innovation network to promote synergy in China, the innovation performance will be accelerated more efficiently.

AB We present a new perspective on entrepreneurship within multinational corporations (MNCs) based on entrepreneurial contexts and knowledge coordination. First, we develop a framework of four contexts for analyzing different mechanisms by which MNCs pursue opportunities across borders. Second, we develop propositions for predicting how entrepreneurial knowledge is coordinated (transferred and internalized) between these contexts. The coordination problem lies at the heart of the phenomenon of entrepreneurship within modern MNCs although its inter-contextual nature has been neglected in the literature. In our view, MNC entrepreneurship comprises (1) a superset of entrepreneurial activity from four distinct contexts: and (2) the inter-contextual coordination of knowledge of opportunity, knowledge of solution, and learning from outcomes of initiatives. Drawing primarily on the knowledge-based view of the MNC, we argue that knowledge coordination between multiple entrepreneurial contexts constitutes a socially complex capability and potential source of competitive advantage for the MNC. This holistic view of MNC entrepreneurship raises fresh questions for researchers and strategic leaders of MNCs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explain how a buying organization's desorptive capacity relative to its supply network enhances the organization's supply chain competence. The research also analyzes the contingent role of the balanced and combined dimensions of ambidexterity in this relationship.
   Design/methodology/approach Empirical results are obtained through analysis of survey data from a sample of 270 European firms. Hierarchical regression analysis is used to test the hypotheses.
   Findings The results confirm, first, the positive and significant relationship between the buying organization's desorptive capacity and supply chain competence; and, second, the key moderating role of organizational ambidexterity, especially in its combined dimension, in this relationship.
   Practical implications The study suggests that desorptive capacity is key to the organization's contribution to supply chain competitiveness. The authors also provide practitioners with better understanding of the extent to which they should attempt to balance exploration and exploitation or/and to maximize both simultaneously when seeking greater benefit from desorptive capacity.
   Originality/value This study extends desorptive capacity research to supply chain management. It responds to calls in the desorptive capacity literature for deeper understanding of the benefits of desorptive capacity and of the role organizational ambidexterity plays in the success of desorptive capacity. By analyzing the independent effects of the combined and balanced dimensions of ambidexterity, the authors advance conceptual and operational understanding of the role of ambidexterity needed in the literature.

AB A genealogical theory of new venture creation posits that "parent" firm routines are transferred to "progeny" ventures founded by the former employees of these parents. This study examines how the knowledge available to a venture from its parent firms and individual founders, as well as its initial technological direction, influences its own creation of impactful knowledge. We argue that new knowledge creation involves the recombination of underlying knowledge elements and hypothesize that the degree to which the venture's knowledge domain overlaps with the parents' knowledge has positive, but diminishing effects on the impact of knowledge created by the venture. We also predict that the breadth of founders' personal knowledge has a positive effect, but that the divergence between individual founders' and parent firm's knowledge domains has a negative effect on the creation of impactful knowledge by the venture. We test our predictions using a sample of 219 biotechnology ventures founded over the eleven year period 1990-2000 and tracked through 2010. Our results contribute to the entrepreneurship, knowledge creation, and genealogical literatures. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this paper, a cognitive community-based analytic framework is established to investigate intra-cluster knowledge diffusion. The results from both a case study on a sock-manufacturing cluster in China and an agent-based simulation indicate that the initial pattern of knowledge distribution has a significant impact on the process of knowledge diffusion in a cluster. A cluster with a higher knowledge level but lower knowledge heterogeneity enjoys higher efficiency of knowledge diffusion.

AB This study is to compare the knowledge-technological flow networks to the competitiveness in two shrimp producing groups from the municipality of Ahome (Sinaloa). It has focused on an analysis of social networks and the information was obtained by the application of a survey to a sample of 60 shrimp producing companies (7 belongs to Sinaloa Aquaculture Cluster and the 53 left belong to the social and private sector). It was found that in the Sinaloa Aquaculture Cluster the network indicators and the competitiveness scale were higher than the rest of the farms. This means that there is a greater transfer of information between the actors, and they also play a key role within the structure, as well as the limited size of the population in the organizations that make up the cluster shrimp farming as well as being focused on geographic and sectorial ambits. For that, is not possible to assume a causal relation and generalize the findings neither. Unity and strategic organization are key factors for this type of productive articulations, as they constitute an important source of social welfare and have a favorable impact on regional development.

AB This paper examines the effect of relational factors on knowledge transfer within strategic buyer-supplier exchange. Prior research examining inter-firm knowledge transfer has focused almost exclusively on horizontal forms of governance such as strategic alliances and joint ventures, whilst research on vertical forms, such as buyer-supplier relationships, is limited. We test the effect of four important relational properties: cooperation, trust, relationship duration and supplier performance. Quantitative data, gathered from 104 UK manufacturing firms in eight industry sectors, are used to analyse the hypothesized relationships through a moderated hierarchical regression model. Our study provides support for the importance of considering relational factors in the transfer of knowledge at the inter-organizational level. In particular, the results indicate that knowledge transfer is positively influenced by the extent of cooperation, but that this relationship is moderated by the level of trust and the performance of the supplier firm. Managerial implications for these findings and future directions for research are then offered.

Given the knowledge-based view of resources inherent in management of technology (MOT), in this study, we adopt an organizational learning framework that considers knowledge to be embedded in three major components of organizationsmembers, tasks and toolsand the networks formed by crossing them. We present research related to these components that is most applicable to MOT. In suggesting future research in MOT, we explicate the framework further by proposing that learning occurs in an organizational context.

AB Applying a new theoretical and empirical approach to intrafirm knowledge transfers, this paper provides some initial insight to the little-researched phenomenon of why some subsidiaries are isolated from knowledge-transfer activities within the multinational corporation (MNC). Knowledge transfer is framed as a problemistic search process initiated by the recipient unit. We show that knowledge flows from units that are perceived to be highly capable to units that perceive themselves to be highly capable. Knowledge flows are also associated with existing levels of communication and reciprocity. Taken together, these findings suggest that knowledge transfers in MNCs typically occur between highly capable members of an "in crowd," and the isolated minority rarely, if ever, engages in knowledge-sharing activities. Finally, we show that the isolated minority underperforms other subsidiaries, suggesting the possibility of a "liability of internal isolation.".

AB Regional clusters have become an inseparable component of modern economies. Spurred by the idea that clusters unrestrictedly encourage firm innovativeness, the cluster approach has particularly gained attention among politicians. Nevertheless, due to a lack of holistic consideration of different influencing variables, the scientific results about the effect of clusters on firm innovative performance are highly contradictive. Consequently, this paper aims to empirically investigate the conditions through which companies can gain from being located in clusters, focussing thereby particularly on moderating variables that relate to possible knowledge spillovers. Therefore, three different levels of analysis are considered separately and interactively. By analysing a unique multilevel dataset of 11.889 companies in Germany evidence is found that being located in a cluster has a positive impact on firm innovativeness. However, the results also indicate that firms benefit unequally within the cluster environment, depending on the specific firm, cluster and market/industry conditions.

AB Research on open innovation mostly focuses on company level aspects of this phenomenon and predominantly investigates open innovation in large firms. Individuals and especially leaders play a vital role in the successful implementation of open innovation. However, research on this important issue has only recently begun to flourish, with research showing the vast occurence of open innovation activities among small and medium-sized companies and the vital role entrepreneurs play for open innovation. In this research, we connect the fields of open innovation and entrepreneurship and employ dynamics capability literature to focus on factors on the individual level (entrepreneurs' openness and network closeness), which affect innovation performance and strategic growth intentions of companies through absorptive capacity. We conceptualise a theoretical model and test it on entrepreneurs samples from two countries (Slovenia and United States) by means of structural equation modelling. The results suggest that entrepreneurial openness is an important antecedent of absorptive capacity and that too much focus on maintaining the same business contacts (network closeness) prevents the company from absorbing trends from outside the company and network. We also show that absorptive capacity is positively related to innovation performance and strategic growth intentions. We discuss the implications for theory and practice.

AB Effectively managing existing tacit knowledge stocks and transferring knowledge between partners contributes to firm capabilities that allow them to differentiate their goods and services from those of their competitors. Because it also helps them to provide greater value to customers, it contributes to the development of a competitive advantage. In highly competitive industries, firms need to focus on proactively managing their knowledge resources to ensure survival. However, the knowledge management process is at times complex especially because of the difficulty involved in conveying tacit knowledge. Due to its latent potential for enabling firms to achieve potential competitive advantage, how firms utilize and transfer stocks of tacit knowledge requires enhanced understanding. In specific, we explain how firms use relational capabilities to build relational capital with partners. In turn, relational capital facilitates the transfer of tacit knowledge between collaborating partners. We develop several propositions regarding the factors likely to influence the transfer of a firm's tacit knowledge resources in strategic alliances. The importance of social capital's relational dimension, relational capital, in this process is highlighted. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose The purpose of this article is to analyze the influence of the diversity of information and the use of Web 2.0 applications on the web positioning of online business information providers. Design/methodology/approach A total of 203 online business information provider websites were selected using three search engines (Google, Yahoo and Bing). This information was encoded to develop two logistic regression models. Findings The results suggest that the knowledge offered and the resources used to transfer this knowledge play important roles in the web positioning of online business information providers. This study found that entrepreneurs mainly seek technological knowledge, and to acquire it, they use various Web 2.0 applications that do not necessarily include social networks. Originality/value This article is novel in that it links the theory of knowledge dissemination with the technologies of the Internet (websites, Web 2.0 applications) and provides evidence of diverse sources of online information that are potentially useful for the entrepreneur of the twentieth century.

AB How do alliances lead to knowledge growth and learning for parent firms? Prior research focuses on knowledge inflows from a partner when a firm enters into an alliance. In this paper, we examine factors that enable firms to make better use of their own knowledge and capabilities as a consequence of alliances. To demonstrate the latter dimension of knowledge growth, we depart from prior research that has focused on cross citations of patents between partners, and instead a study self-citation activity. We examine the effect of four factors on self-citations, each of which reflects distinct learning mechanisms and cooperative dynamics, namely knowledge inflows from the alliance partner, knowledge outflows to the alliance partner, partner characteristics, and alliance governance. Results suggest that knowledge inflows from the partner were positively associated with changes in self-citations in alliance domains, whereas knowledge outflows to the partner had a positive impact on changes in self-citations for the smaller firm in the alliance. In contrast, firm specific knowledge possessed by the partner and equity governance had a negative impact on changes in self-citations in alliance domains. This paper develops a fuller understanding of the learning effects of alliances by highlighting that apart from better utilization of the partner's capabilities, alliances also lead to enhanced utilization of the firm's own knowledge and capabilities in further innovative activity.

AB The university-industry (U-I) innovation community is a boundary-bounded group wherein universities and firms have long-term collaborations and engage in the technology transfer. The increasing community-innovation phenomenon in university-industry collaboration (UIC) is considered crucial in facilitating universities' technology transfer, thus improving member firms' invention output. Most studies examine UIC from the perspective of network or dyadic relationships, paying less attention to the community level, preventing a thorough understanding of the structure and dynamics of U-I innovation communities. Moreover, much remains to be understood about the role of U-I innovation community dynamics in promoting member firms' invention performance. This study maps the U-I innovation community using network community identification based on innovation community theory and social network analysis and investigates the role of U-I innovation community dynamics in the invention productivity of member firms. Using U-I co-patenting data from the China National Intellectual Property Administration between 2000 and 2017, we find that a moderate turnover rate among U-I innovation community members can enhance the invention performance of member firms. We also find that the scale of university technology transfer within the community mediates the relationship between community dynamics and firms' invention performance. This study expands our understanding of the U-I innovation community and sheds new light on its stakeholders.

AB Do informal social ties connecting inventors across distant places promote knowledge flows between them? To measure informal ties, we use a new and direct index of social connectedness of regions based on aggregate Facebook friendships. We use a well-established identification strategy that relies on matching inventor citations with citations from examiners. Moreover, we isolate the specific effect of informal connections, above and beyond formal professional ties (co-inventor networks) and geographic proximity. We identify a significant and robust effect of informal ties on patent citations. Further, we find that the effect of geographic proximity on knowledge flows is entirely explained by informal social ties and professional networks. We also show that the effect of informal social ties on knowledge flows is greater for new entrepreneurs or 'garage inventors', for older or 'forgotten' patents, and for flows across distant technology fields. It has also become increasingly important over the last two decades.

AB Purpose Although collaborative research is believed to be an important means of accessing external knowledge, research on whether taking a strategic network position benefits new product development (NPD) is inconclusive. This study aims to unravel the conditions under which taking a strategic position within a collaborative research network is conducive for a firm's NPD. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on social network theory, absorptive capacity theory and knowledge recombinant studies, this study examines how strategic network positions (i.e. degree centrality and structural holes) and knowledge base cohesion (i.e. local and global cohesion) in tandem affect a firm's NPD. A panel data set of 366 firms in the Chinese automobile sector (2002-2010) is empirically analyzed, using the panel negative binomial approach with random effects and several alternate estimation approaches. Findings This study reveals that, rather than the volume of a firm's knowledge base, its cohesion determines how it absorbs and uses knowledge accrued from collaborative research for NPD. Specifically, this paper finds that centrally positioned firms have greater NPD when their knowledge bases are locally cohesive, while firms spanning structural holes have more NPD when their knowledge bases are globally cohesive. Originality/value Successfully transferring collaborative research outcomes into product innovation is difficult. This study contributes to the literature on strategic network positions and NPD. The findings advance the understanding of knowledge base cohesion's moderating role in explaining how firms absorb and exploit external knowledge for internal innovation. The findings also have important implications for managers who wish to promote product innovation by engaging in collaborative research with external partners.

AB This study rests upon the premise that differences in the productivity performance of multinational enterprises (MNEs) stem from variations in their ability to access and combine globally distributed knowledge reservoirs within one organization. Its contribution lies in demonstrating that this important source of variation is determined by (a) the idiosyncratic manner in which the MNE's network of subsidiaries is structured. (b) the international breadth and depth of this network and (c) its location choices in the global landscape. We find that when multinationals spread their operations across many geographical markets, they benefit from knowledge externalities more than when they concentrate their activities in few countries. We further show that the ability to exploit spatially distant knowledge depends not only on idiosyncrasies specific to the MNE, but also on exogenous forces associated with international variations in appropriability regimes and industry-specific technological opportunities. As our study considers how the subsidiaries of the MNE collectively influence the productivity of the entire group, it captures complementarities and synergies within the group, and deepens understanding of how MNE-specific and location bound factors jointly shape performance outcomes.

AB Multinational companies (MNCs) are geographically widespread production networks that can coordinate operations and activities in more than one country. MNCs transfer innovations, expertise, knowledge and advanced technologies to their host countries through their subsidiaries. Therefore, multinational companies are seen as transfer intermediaries distributing international technologies and innovations. MNCs help to bridge the existing technology gap between developed and developing countries. Due to the multilocation nature of MNCs, the study aims to examine the various drivers that influence Hungarian MNCs' R&D collaborations, making them choose to collaborate either with local partners or with partners in the countries of their headquarters. The paper reports on the preliminary findings of an on-going comparative research focused on understanding the key drivers of innovations and competitiveness in Hungary. For our empirical analysis, drawing on data from the Eurostat's harmonized Community Innovation Survey 2010-2012, we used the probit regression model. Since many studies have shown that innovation processes in companies are based on the same principles or similar framework, it is possible to generalize the results of the analysed data and successfully put the recommendations into practice. Our analysis provided mixed results; it has demonstrated that marketing orientations, expenditures devoted to research and development, absorptive capacity, firm size as well as funding support provided to Hungarian MNCs influenced their choice of collaborating partners. Hungarian MNCs were highly probable to collaborate with both local and foreign partners in the enterprise group, while preferring to cooperate with local universities rather than foreign ones.

AB The paper assesses the role for innovation of one aspect which has been generally overlooked by evolutionary economic geography: context. It analyses how context shapes the impact of collaboration on firm-level innovation for 1604 firms located in the five largest city regions of Norway. Specifically, the analysis shows how the benefits to firms of collaborating within regional, national, and international innovation networks are affected by the knowledge endowments of the region within which the firm is located. Using a logit regression analysis, we find, first, that only national and international networking have a significant positive impact on the likelihood of innovation (the former only for process innovation), whereas the regional knowledge endowments have no direct effect. Second, regional cooperation is particularly effective in regions with high investments in R&D, whereas international cooperation is important in regions with an educated workforce - and regional and national collaboration may be ineffective in such cases. We conclude that, in the case of Norway, context is essential in determining the capacity of firms to set up networks and innovate. Regions with an educated workforce can use the resulting absorptive capacity to successfully assimilate knowledge being diffused through global pipelines from faraway places. However, this absorptive capacity is likely to be heavily filtered if regional firms mainly rely on internal connections within Norway. (c) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB I examine the extent to which foreign R&D satellites of multinational firms act as a medium for the international diffusion of knowledge. Using patents from the United States Patent and Trademark Office, I compare the frequency with which headquarters patents are cited by third-party firms in the satellite's host country relative to a control group of patents, and this both before and after the establishment of the satellite (using a difference-in-differences approach). The results suggest that the satellite increases the flow of knowledge from the multinational's headquarters to firms in the satellite's host country. This satellite effect on knowledge diffusion is largest in host countries and sectors with strong but not world-class capabilities that have both the motivation and absorptive capacity to learn from foreign parties. The findings also suggest that knowledge diffusion is greatest when satellites are staffed with inventors that have previously either patented with other local firms (thus having stronger local social networks) or with the headquarters (thus having headquarters knowledge).

AB Purpose This study aims to identify critical factors and examine their impact on alliance performance from an organizational learning point of view. Design/methodology/approach A modified total interpretive structural modeling (M-TISM) methodology was used in this study. The different paths/links in the developed M-TISM model were further validated by using the Mahindra-Ford alliance case study. Findings In this study, a total of seven critical factors were identified using an extensive literature review, and a hierarchical model was developed. Results show that prior alliance experience, inter-partner learning, knowledge transfer, absorptive capacity and knowledge internalization have a positive on the alliance productivity and performance. Furthermore, the findings indicate that prior alliance experience remains essential for alliance productivity and performance, while knowledge transfer and absorptive capacity can contribute to inter-partner learning and knowledge internalization in strategic alliances. Research limitations/implications This study can help managers and policymakers to understand the identified critical factors from an organizational learning perspective and understand their impact on the alliance performance in a competitive environment. The managers should know that previous alliance experience, learning from partner firms, building an absorptive capacity, etc., are necessary to achieve superior alliance productivity and performance. For academicians, the M-TISM methodology used in this study can provide a mechanism to perform exploratory research and build a hierarchical model in different management research fields. Originality/value The study fills research gaps by identifying key factors, developing a hierarchical model, and examining their impact on the performance of strategic alliances in the Indian automotive industry.

   Three key findings: dyadic willingness positively affects transfer efficiency and effectiveness willingness HQ involvement negatively effects transfer efficiency; HQ involvement negatively moderates the effect of willingness on transfer effectiveness
   HQ face a dilemma in managing lateral transfers: on the one hand, the network structure that typifies many MNCs has beneficial impacts on the performance of the transfer process; on the other hand the HQ need to ensure that lateral transfers initiated by subsidiaries ('organic' transfers) are in line with MNC strategy. However the findings from our study strongly suggest that HQ direct involvement in the transfer process is at best a very blunt instrument for achieving a resolution of this dilemma.

AB This paper explores the R&D cooperation determinants of the innovative companies belonging to the Spanish manufacturing sector. Our findings suggest that the variable R&D subsidy is endogenous, significant, and has a strong positive influence on R&D cooperation. This is a clear indication that the achievement of public aid is often conditioned by the obligation for companies to cooperate in R&D. We have also found that the differentiation strategy variable is significant and has a negative influence on R&D cooperation. Companies positioned in a differentiation strategy probably own and use some different knowledge from other companies. Consequently, they will not have much interest in taking advantage of the spillovers generated by other companies. It is therefore logical that they are reluctant to establish cooperation agreements on R&D. Therefore, companies positioned in the differentiation strategy need public policies to support R&D that are not conditioned to the establishment of cooperation agreements.

AB This paper advances the concepts of knowledge accession and knowledge acquisition in strategic alliances by identifying supplementary and complementary dimensions to these knowledge transfer modes. Complementary knowledge transfer reflects the similarity of knowledge that the partners have and is conducted in pursuit of higher efficiency and productivity to enhance partner firms' existing competitiveness. Supplementary knowledge transfer occurs when partners each possess distinctive core competences and the information that is acquired or accessed increases the business scope of partners. As knowledge accession entails knowledge amalgamation that does not involve organizational learning, costs associated with the transfer process are lower and trust is easier to establish than in the case of knowledge acquisition. The paper reviews the implications of these transfer modes on trust building in alliances and their costs implications and presents a number of propositions for further exploration.

AB This study investigates university-industry (U-I) innovation collaboration and proposes a renewed and empirically tested conceptual approach to analyse it. The motivation for the research emerged from the realisation that the majority of studies on university-industry innovation collaboration on organisational level present limited verification of why some seemingly similar collaboration projects fail while others thrive. Therefore, we aimed for reconceptualization of the way university-industry collaboration is analysed by developing the respective approach that was empirically tested via multiple case-study research of 12 cases. The approach combines elements of the U-I collaboration literature with a model of interaction from semiotics and boundary-crossing ideas from organisation theory. The novelty of this approach lies in explaining the heterogenity and variation of U-I collaboration on individual level. The interaction model from the semiotics enables distinct U-I collaboration patterns to emerge. In a two-dimensional model it becomes clear that choosing the appropriate partner for potentially successful collaboration means matching the levels of preconditions between partners. The main contribution of this study is twofold: an interdisciplinary approach for analysing U-I collaboration using a multiple case-study research design and the explanation of relevant preconditions individual rather than institutional levels of motivation and absorptive capacity as critical aspects that determine the likelihood of the success or failure of such collaboration.

AB We explore how more exactly copying a blueprint for establishing a franchise network in a new country influences franchising network growth. We test opposing hypotheses using panel data involving the transfer of franchising knowledge to 23 different countries, measuring the degree to which master licensees 'copy exactly' knowledge concerning how to grow a network in their country and the effect that their approach has on subsequent network growth. We conclude that a strategy of copying more exactly seems to enhance growth and that the benefits of more exactly replicating knowledge in the 1st year of a local network's existence persist for several years. Thus. innovation, in this specific context, seems to hinder firm growth. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB While templates may facilitate knowledge sharing within the base-of-the-pyramid, it is often necessary for entrepreneurs to adapt the template for reasons of resource scarcity. We explore the role of social interaction in determining whether these adaptations are beneficial or detrimental. Our results suggest that interactions between the entrepreneur and technical experts who understand the why' behind each practice can result in improved performance while interactions with entrepreneurial peers can produce more varied results. Thus, the type of knowledge generated through social interaction plays a significant role in the degree to which adaptations to templates are principled versus presumptive in nature.

AB Motorboat racing is a sport organized as public gambling in Japan. As well as physical strength and driving technique, skills to adjust equipment are critical for racers to win a race. Based on the contingency theory of social capital, this study analysed comprehensive panel data of motorboat racers and revealed that bonding and bridging social capital had different impacts on performance according to life cycle stages of racers and changes in regulation. First, bonding social capital has a positive impact on performance when racers are less experienced and most need psychological aid stemming from strong ties. Second, bridging social capital has a positive impact on performance when racers are more experienced and have accumulated absorptive capacity to learn efficiently from diverse sources of knowledge. Third, both bonding and bridging social capital lose their explanatory power after the changes in regulation that shifted ownership of propellers from racers to the authority, which could mitigate the significance of the formation of small groups among racers to share cost and knowledge regarding the improvement in propellers. Research and managerial implications of the findings are discussed.

AB Interorganizational scholars have long thought about how firms learn through buyer relationships. However, it is not clear whether dyadic learning gains are susceptible to imitation or are only inherited and whether these gains decay over time or are of an enduring nature. In this paper, I import ideas from the organizational imprinting literature into the interorganizational literature and apply the knowledge-based and learning views of the firm to examine how suppliers with differing initial endowments learn to work together with a buyer. The findings from an inductive multiple case study of spinoff and nonspinoff suppliers of an automotive manufacturer parent in Turkey reveal the following three learning mechanisms: informal relationships and social capital, transfer of routines, and shared identity. Although nonspinoff suppliers also exhibit evidence of several learning processes to a certain extent, spinoff suppliers' deeper relationship, in particular their shared identity, with their parent based on their direct parental heritage tends to be more difficult for them to copy. No matter how hard nonspinoff suppliers try, they have "one hand tied behind their back," they remain stepchildren, and they never truly become a biological child. By providing a novel setting and a rich set of qualitative data on the learning behaviors of these two types of suppliers, this study teases apart the knowledge and resources that can be "learned from external sources" versus those that can "only be inherited."

AB Current results of direct relationships between collaboration and innovation capability on performance in tourism contexts are inconsistent. This research is to uncover roles of collaborative routines on promoting relationships between internal and service innovation capabilities as two distinct mechanisms, and performance. The study also examines the contingent effect of knowledge search on performance. Survey data from 181 samples from the Thai tourism industry are gathered for analyses. Findings demonstrate that knowledge search and internal innovation capability have a direct impact on performance, whereas the effect of service innovation capability on performance is significant only in the presence of collaborative routines.

AB This study aims to examine the relationship between the acquisition of knowledge through informal channels and performance of innovation projects. We propose that three forms of informal knowledge exchange, namely, knowledge sharing, knowledge presentation and knowledge transfer, positively impact the perceived performance of innovation projects. A survey of 360 individuals involved in innovation projects whose answers were analysed with PLSs reveals that knowledge, obtained through knowledge sharing and knowledge transfer with third parties outside the company by informal route and the simultaneous use of an innovation intermediary as part of these informal exchanges, positively impacts the three elements that have been chosen to measure the operational performance of innovation projects, namely, cost, time and quality. These results provide major contributions to the academic and managerial point of view and open up new vistas for research that derived directly from the demonstration that open innovation not only has to relay on formal agreements, but also to take into account the informal way of knowledge acquisition.

AB The literature on organizational learning asserts that external learning is often limited geographically and technologically. We scrutinize to what extent organizations acquire external knowledge by accessing external knowledge repositories. We argue that professional service firms (PSFs) grant access to nonlocalized knowledge repositories and thereby not only facilitate external learning but also help to overcome localization. Focusing on patent law firms, we test our predictions using a unique dataset of 544,820 pairs of European patent applications. Analyzing patterns of knowledge flows captured in patent citations, we find that accessing a PSF's repository facilitates the acquisition of external knowledge. As the effect is more pronounced for knowledge that is distant to a focal organization, we conclude that having access to a knowledge repository compensates for localization disadvantages.

AB Environmental management has become increasingly important for enterprises and has been considered and influenced by stakeholders. Most studies have examined the impact of a single relationship network on enterprises' environmental management behavior. This paper establishes a conceptual framework including the direct impact of multirelationship social networks on the maturity of environmental management and the mediating role of absorptive capacity based on stakeholder theory, social network theory and the resource-based view. Using more than 400,000 big data texts, including announcements, social responsibility reports and annual reports issued by China's high energy-consuming enterprises during 2010-2018, we construct a multirelationship social network, investigate the heterogeneity of environmental management by an improved maturity model, and conduct regression analysis to verify the conceptual model. The results show that (1) the network breadth of most enterprises is 7 or 8; the network depth and knowledge heterogeneity are between 500-1000 and 0.5-0.6, respectively; (2) the number of enterprises in the initial level of environmental management has decreased significantly, but the number in the leading level has not increased appreciably, as expected; (3) most enterprises tend to take measures of pollution reduction and energy savings, but green offices such as creating a safer and healthier workplace for their employees are rarely chosen; and (4) the breadth, depth and knowledge heterogeneity of the network can improve environmental management, and the absorptive capacity has a partial mediating effect on this relationship. Finally, several implications are proposed. The importance of multirelationship social network should be recognized and actively reflected through various channels. Measures of green offices or environmental certification can be considered. Enterprises should strive to strengthen their absorptive capacity from the resources in the social network to optimize their environmental management capacity.

AB Different subsets of social networks may explain knowledge sharing outcomes in different ways. One subset may counteract another subset, and one subset may explain one outcome but not another. We found support for these arguments in an analysis of a sample of 121 new-product development teams. Within-team and interunit networks had different effects on the outcomes of three knowledge-sharing phases: deciding whether to seek knowledge across subunits, search costs, and costs of transfers. These results suggest that research on knowledge sharing can be advanced by studying how multiple networks affect various phases of knowledge sharing.

AB On the basis of an exploratory multiple-case qualitative longitudinal study in the fashion industry, this article describes how digital technologies enabled choices among different types of supply chain governance. In doing so, this study responds to calls for governance-oriented longitudinal explorations and suggests an alternative path of governance choices in which the digital technologies become the platform that allows a dynamic discourse between outsourcer and outsourcee. Our results show that, when firms decide to leverage their performances through the adoption of information technology, they need to define their knowledge transfer capacities in order to adopt the appropriate type of governance model. With this article, we contribute to the global value chain literature adding to the knowledge transfer dimension.

AB Contemporary business organizations are increasingly turning their attention to value co-creation using social media between individual customers and business organizations in the process of new product development (NPD). However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying social-media-based customer-firm co-creation and their implications for business value in NPD. To address this knowledge gap, this study develops a model from the perspective of organizational learning and social capital to examine how the social-media-based customer-firm co-creation mechanism conceptualized as the structural, cognitive, and relational dimension of social capital influences the first-order knowledge outcome (knowledge transfer effectiveness) and second-order dynamic capability outcome (absorptive capacity), and how these co-creation outcomes ultimately influence organizational performance. The model is tested using survey data from 149 Chinese mobile application developers. The results indicate that social-media-based structural, cognitive, and relational linkage, in particular the structural linkage, is an important co-creation mechanism to improve organizational performance. Knowledge transfer effectiveness and absorptive capacity have significant mediating effects in this co-creation mechanism-outcomes-performance framework. Further, the moderating effects of social media use level on the relationships between co-creation mechanism and outcomes are largely supported. The study contributes to theory and practice by shedding light on the social-media-based customer-firm co-creation in NPD at a process level.

AB P>In this paper, we theoretically and empirically investigate factors that contribute to product innovation by firms in emerging markets. Combining the innovation literature with the latecomer literature on 'catch-up' strategies of firms in newly industrialized economies, we posit that access to foreign knowledge is essential for fostering product innovation. In particular, we investigate how innovation clusters formed by inward foreign direct investments in an emerging market and export activities of a firm are effective channels for acquiring foreign knowledge. We also suggest firms that invest in research and development and marketing activities benefit further from access to foreign knowledge due to increased absorptive capacity. Empirically, we employ information on over 160,000 indigenous manufacturing firms in China in 2005-2006. We find strong empirical support for our theoretical framework and conclude by discussing the implications for both theory and managerial practice.

AB This article reviews the developing links between economic geography and innovation theory and practical management in terms of research and literature. This article identifies five main themes, where this has been most evident, namely: coordination issues; proximity and geographical environment (including clusters, spillovers, agglomerations and networks); flows and connections: transactions and trade; enterprise and entrepreneurship; and innovation and knowledge. This article positions the papers in this Special Issue within this framework and identifies areas for future research between the two fields.

AB This article identifies and theorises the interorganisational socialisation mechanisms that facilitate the knowledge dynamic capabilities of organisations brought together within the applied context of a U.K. Local Enterprise Partnership. Focusing on the Sheffield City Region's Creative and Digital Industries Sector Group, the data for this study were messages posted to the Creative and Digital Industries Sector Group's online consultation platform. Data analysis proceeded through inductive thematic analysis. It is revealed that collaborative workspaces, business networks resources, and pathways to internationalisation are perceived to play an important role in facilitating interorganisational learning. These knowledge socialisation mechanisms are essential to avoid regional competency traps. The article identifies and discusses knowledge socialisation mechanisms that are perceived to play a key role in transferring knowledge between members of the regional system of innovation. In identifying and discussing knowledge socialisation mechanisms, this paper offers knowledge management theorists and practitioners more specifically, regional knowledge brokers and regional development managers-actionable insight into a range of strategies that reinforce social ties and increase the flow of knowledge with a view to improving innovation outcomes.

AB University entrepreneurial ecosystems are increasingly important in facilitating innovation and entrepreneurial opportunities in today's knowledge-based economies. However, we have an incomplete understanding of the demand side of university entrepreneurial ecosystems regarding the role of the entrepreneurial firm as the key user of university knowledge. We propose that use of university knowledge positively influences entrepreneurial firm performance and that the entrepreneurial firm's resources and capabilities facilitate its ability to create value from university knowledge. We test our hypotheses on survey data of 3853 knowledge-intensive entrepreneurial firms from 10 European countries. Our study contributes to an increased understanding of the economic, societal and technological contributions of universities by empirically illustrating the role of firm resources and capabilities as moderators of value in university entrepreneurial ecosystems.

AB This paper presents a novel approach to capture 'buzz', the vibrancy and knowledge exchange propensity of localised informal communication flows. Building on a conceptual framework based on relational economic geography, we argue the content of buzz may allow to probe into the character of places and investigate what is 'in the air' within regional entrepreneurial milieux. In particular, we analyse big data to listen for the presence of buzz about innovation - defined by discursive practices that reflect an innovative atmosphere - and explore how this may influence regional firm creation. Using information from 180 million geolocated Tweets comprising almost two billion words across NUTS3 regions in the UK for the year 2014, our results offer novel evidence, robust to different model specifications, that regions characterised by a relatively higher intensity of discussion and vibrancy around topics related to innovation may provide a more effective set of informal resources for sharing and recombination of ideas, defining regional capabilities to support and facilitate entrepreneurial processes. The findings contribute to the literature on the intangible dimensions in the geography of innovation and offer new insights on the potential of natural language processing for economic geography research.

AB This work contributes to previous research on the relationship between specific features of a regional knowledge space and the technological progress of the region. In particular, the main element of originality of this work is to have singled out the determinants of the technological progress intensity and relevance. We acknowledge the importance of knowledge assets for new knowledge production, and we identify path-dependent processes that allow a region to become increasingly competitive in terms of innovation potential. In particular, adopting an evolutionary view of regional development, we describe the regional knowledge space through four crucial characteristics: 1) technological knowledge base, 2) technological cumulativeness, 3) technological diversification, and 4) technological relatedness. We then measure to what extent each of the knowledge space's characteristics differently affects the technological progress intensity and relevance of the region. A longitudinal study of 269 European regions over the period 1996-2012 was organized using data from REGPAT and Eurostat databases. Results show that technological relatedness affects positively both the intensity and relevance of the technological progress of European regions and that the other components of the knowledge space show a different impact on the two features of the technological progress. Finally, implications for EU policies supporting and stimulating regional technological progress are discussed.

AB The aim of this article is to suggest a framework for examining the way national policy mixes are responding to the challenges and opportunities of globally distributed knowledge networks, cross-sectoral technology flows and consequently open innovation processes occurring on an international scale. We argue that the purpose of public research and innovation policy remains one of developing and sustaining territorial knowledge bases capable of growing and supporting internationally competitive industries. But the rules of the game have changed. Public policy now needs to carefully balance between: a) promoting the formation of international linkages for knowledge sourcing and information exposure; b) providing incentives for domestic industry intramural R&D for building absorptive capacity and knowledge accumulation; and c) sustaining domestic networking to allow accumulated knowledge to diffuse and recombine.

AB In this study, we focus on the pattern of cross-regional R&D collaborations through which voluntary knowledge flows and accompanying spillovers might occur. Our aim is to investigate the processes that give rise to the observed network configuration in order to identify hampering factors of knowledge diffusion, with a particular interest in the role of geographical proximity and differences in territorial features. We make use of the data on project proposals submitted to the 7th Framework Programme in the field of biotechnology. We build a non-valued inter-regional R&D cooperation network among a set of European regions and study its formation through exponential random graph models (Frank and Strauss in J Am Stat Assoc 81(395):832-842, 1986; Wasserman and Pattison in Psychometrika 61(3):401-425, 1996). Besides the role played by absorptive capacities, the empirical results reveal that contiguity affects the pattern of cross-regional collaborations not only via edge formation among neighbours but also through a triadic closure process which links neighbouring regions to non-neighbours. Furthermore, triadic closure is found out to be in play among highly populated regions and regions including capital cities.

AB Purpose - This paper aims to seek to explain the influence of power asymmetry and the moderating role of an organization's absorptive and desorptive capacity on enhancing supply chain competence from its orientation to open innovation with its supply network.
   Design/methodology/approach - To perform this study, the authors use data collected from 262 European firms. They apply regression analysis to test the moderating role of an organization's absorptive and desorptive capacity on enhancing its supply chain competence from its orientation to open innovation.
   Findings - The results confirm both the influence of power asymmetry and absorptive capacity on obtaining benefits that derive from an organization's orientation to open innovation. The results do not, however, support the moderating effect of an organization's desorptive capacity. Subsequent analyses performed in the study show that organizations that achieve complementarity among their own absorptive capacity and the capacities of its supply network manage to obtain greater benefits from its orientation to open innovation.
   Originality/value - This paper responds to the need to study innovation in the context of a supply network and respond to calls in the literature on open innovation and supply chain management for the need to study the moderating role of absorptive and desorptive capacity.

This study adopts a duel network perspective to examine how the source networks and recipient networks in which international joint venture (IJV) partners operate influence inter-organizational transfer and diffusion of capabilities. We study multiple cases in the Chinese automotive industry to investigate how various factors of MNE source networks and the local recipient networks (business groups in China or qiye jituan) affect knowledge transfer from the MNE source networks into IJVs and knowledge diffusion from IJVs to their local recipient networks. The study suggests ways that the dual networks influence both types of knowledge transfer. We found both positive and negative effects of recipient and source networks on knowledge inflow to the IJVs and knowledge outflow from IJVs. The dual networks perspective is particularly relevant for emerging economies where the asymmetry between the knowledge, power and motivations of the recipient and source networks may significantly affect the knowledge transfer outcome.

AB Coopetition can provide access to competitors' valuable knowledge. However, coopetition has high opportunism risks; therefore, firms aim to protect their own knowledge against leakage and prevent coopetitors' leveraging their knowledge. This study examines how the firm's alliance orientation and its network size influence the leveraging of knowledge (inlearning) gained from a coopetitor. A survey of 366 firms in the medical device industry shows that firms achieve inlearning from a coopetitor only through both a high alliance orientation and a greater number of alliance partners. The study reveals two firm types according to how firms achieve inlearning using coopetition. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, we examine the structural characteristics of supply networks and investigate the relationship between a firm's supply network accessibility and interconnectedness and its innovation output. We also examine potential moderating effects of absorptive capacity and supply network partner innovativeness on innovation output. We hypothesize that firms will experience greater innovation output from (I) higher levels of supply network accessibility and supply network interconnectedness, (2) the interaction between the levels of these two structural characteristics, (3) the moderating role of absorptive capacity on supply network accessibility and the moderating role of supply network partner innovativeness on supply network interconnectedness. Supply network partner relationships are drawn in the context of the electronics industry using data from multiple sources. We use social network analysis to create measures for each supply network structural characteristic. Using regression techniques to test the relationship between these structural characteristics and firm innovation for a sample of 390 firms, our findings suggest that supply network accessibility has a significant association with a firm's innovation output. The results also indicate that interconnected supply networks strengthen the association between supply network accessibility and innovation output. Moreover, the influence of the two structural characteristics on innovation output can be enhanced by a firm's absorptive capacity and level of supply network partner innovativeness. By addressing the need for deeper structural analysis, this study contributes to supply chain research by accounting for the embedded nature of ties in supply networks, and showing how these structural characteristics influence the knowledge and information flows residing within a firm's supply network.

AB Background: Health systems worldwide struggle to identify, adopt, and implement in a timely and system-wide manner the best-evidence-informed-policy-level practices. Yet, there is still only limited evidence about individual and institutional best practices for fostering the use of scientific evidence in policy-making processes The present project is the first national-level attempt to (1) map and structurally analyze-quantitatively-health-relevant policy-making networks that connect evidence production, synthesis, interpretation, and use; (2) qualitatively investigate the interaction patterns of a subsample of actors with high centrality metrics within these networks to develop an in-depth understanding of evidence circulation processes; and (3) combine these findings in order to assess a policy network's "absorptive capacity" regarding scientific evidence and integrate them into a conceptually sound and empirically grounded framework.
   Methods: The project is divided into two research components. The first component is based on quantitative analysis of ties (relationships) that link nodes (participants) in a network. Network data will be collected through a multi-step snowball sampling strategy. Data will be analyzed structurally using social network mapping and analysis methods. The second component is based on qualitative interviews with a subsample of the Web survey participants having central, bridging, or atypical positions in the network. Interviews will focus on the process through which evidence circulates and enters practice. Results from both components will then be integrated through an assessment of the network's and subnetwork's effectiveness in identifying, capturing, interpreting, sharing, reframing, and recodifying scientific evidence in policy-making processes.
   Discussion: Knowledge developed from this project has the potential both to strengthen the scientific understanding of how policy-level knowledge transfer and exchange functions and to provide significantly improved advice on how to ensure evidence plays a more prominent role in public policies.

AB This paper investigates knowledge flows that a leading firm might deal to transform its core competencies, through a case study about IBM. The transformation of IBM from a hardware company to a knowledge service provider is strongly dependent upon different knowledge sources and areas, different capabilities fed by different science and engineering fields. Our theoretical framework presents how the literature on innovation has been enriched by elaborations on dynamic capabilities of firms, on the role of knowledge and knowledge flows as a source of those capabilities and on patent citations as statistical tool to capture those knowledge flows. This paper integrates those three different approaches using patent citations statistics to measure knowledge flows behind IBM's changing capabilities. Our contribution to this literature is an articulation of a historical summary of the evolution of IBM with an empirical analysis of those changes through patent citations statistics.

AB Research Summary The flow of knowledge is closely linked to proximity. While extensive works show that long-term geographic proximity affects work behavior, little is known about the effect of short-term colocation, such as conferences. Using participant data at Gordon Research Conferences, we estimate difference-in-differences and instrumental variable models, which show that attendees who have no prior within-conference collaborations are more likely to collaborate with other attendees, and that the researchers who have worked previously with other attendees are more likely to continue their collaborations. We also find that researchers who are junior, are located closer to the conference venue, and have established prior ties to the conference draw more collaborative benefits from temporary colocation across organizations. Thus, going to a conference alters the creation of collaborations. Managerial Summary Managers face important decisions with long-term strategic ramifications regarding where to locate offices, plants, and R&D centers, as well as how to lay out workspaces inside the firm to enhance knowledge spillover and collaboration. Permanent proximity, however, may be difficult and sometimes impossible to attain. One potential way of overcoming the distance disadvantage in knowledge spillover and tie formation is through temporary colocation events that bring together individuals from distant locations in an environment of temporary proximity. We find that individuals who attend temporary colocation events across organizational boundaries are more likely to collaborate with one another subsequently. Hence, managers of firms should pledge substantial funds for employees to participate in these events so as to impact the subsequent direction of R&D activities.

AB The article investigates whether the history of individuals' spatial relocation has an impact on their propensity to perform an entrepreneurial entry and post-entry performance of firms they start. By looking at entrepreneurs in the IT services sector in Swedish non-core regions between 1991 and 2010, the article investigates the interaction between individuals' embeddedness in local networks and their exposure to external knowledge accumulation opportunities across different geographical settings, as well as its impact on their entrepreneurial activities. The results of the analysis suggest that individuals with broad spatial relocation histories are more likely to start IT firms in non-core regions, which, in turn, may be expected to survive longer. It is, therefore, claimed that non-local knowledge accumulated through spatial relocation is an important complement to embeddedness in local networks in non-core regions. This complementarity is further related to the evolution of the IT services sector over time.

AB Based on arguments from network research, academic entrepreneurship literature, and knowledge-based theory, this article applies a contingency approach to analyze, in the context of academic spin-offs (ASOs), the relationship between the size and the frequency of contacts of the industry network and the three components of the knowledge conversion capability (KCC): conceptualization and visioning, configuration and design, and embodiment and integration. Specifically, we suggest that the appropriate industry network configuration depends on two contingency factors: the knowledge task underlying the different components of KCC-search and transfer-and the tacit vs. codified character of the knowledge base of the ASO. From the analysis of 167 Spanish ASOs, our results indicate that the relationship between industry network size and frequency of contacts and KCC is affected by the two contingency factors being considered in this study.

AB Purpose This study aims to investigate the risks associated with managing the dispersed knowledge in inter-organizational arrangements for innovation. Specifically, it proposes a model to analyze the knowledge management risks in open innovation, applied in four steps. Design/methodology/approach Initially, the authors carried out a systematic literature review (SLR) on the concepts that connect knowledge management, inter-organizational arrangements for innovation and risks. The SLR results led to a complementary theoretical review on the conceptual elements in question. Based on the findings, the authors have developed a model to analyze the knowledge management risks in open innovation, which was validated by experts. It was then studied the case of GOL Airlines, a company that uses innovation to overcome the paradox between low-cost and full service in the commercial air transportation industry, considering the application and adjustment of the proposed model. Findings Open innovation is one of the inter-organizational arrangement types most applied in the context of innovation. Relations between agents are the primary sources of risks when managing the dispersed knowledge in these arrangements. The authors have found five main risks associated, namely, risk of the innovative effort does not reach the expected objective, risk of knowledge transfer being ineffective, risk of misappropriation of value, risk of dependency (lock-in) and risk of relations. Practical implications The practical implication is the proposition of a procedure for applying the model to analyze the knowledge management risks in open innovation, which makes it a prescriptive model for identifying risks. The proposed model is described in four steps, namely, to identify the agents in the environment of the value of open innovation; to identify the types of relations of each agent; to consider the barriers to knowledge management in innovation; and to assess the risks considering the possibilities derived from the agents, their relationships and the barriers. The model is applied in the GOL case and the results are presented. Originality/value First, it uses a novel approach to investigate open innovation while studying its risks. This approach considers the knowledge is dispersed and flows from one organization to another through a combination of relations inside the environment of value where the open innovation materializes. Second, it contributes to theory development by opening a research front that fuses four areas: risk management, knowledge management, innovation and inter-organizational arrangements. Third, this paper proposes a theoretical model and presents its operationalization. The study aims to make an impact beyond academia and uses a case study to illustrate the model application in a real and interesting open innovation project to support the business model at GOL Airlines.

AB Research on knowledge flows in multinational corporations has grown considerably over the last 15 years or so. Part of the growth has resulted in the field becoming more "fluid" and thus prone to multiple definitions and measures of the same notions and constructs, as well as leading to contrary findings. We systematically and critically review the literature on knowledge flows in multinational corporations that has defined the subsidiary as the focal unit of analysis. We classify existing studies into four categories depending on the focus of examination: outcomes of knowledge flows, knowledge characteristics, actors involved in the knowledge flows, and relationships between these actors. On the basis of 92 articles published in 15 top management and international business journals from 1996 to 2009 inclusive we identify key accomplishments, existing gaps and future research directions.

AB Knowledge flow between two firms has been found to be enhanced by both technological relatedness and social interaction. We build on work in education psychology and consider how cognitive and social aspects of learning may be compensatory. Using a sample of 61 alliances involving Eli Lilly and its partners, we find the importance of social interaction between Lilly and its partner to partner learning decreased as their technological relatedness increased. Likewise, the importance of technological relatedness to partner learning decreased as social interaction increased. This study provides nuance on the criticality of technological relatedness and social interaction for learning. Copyright (C) 2012 Strategic Management Society.

AB While much research has been conducted on the link between embeddedness and innovation outcomes, less attention has been paid on how and when MNE subsidiaries can effectively leverage their internal embeddedness to achieve greater innovation performance. We hypothesize knowledge transfer as a mediating mechanism to channel the potential role of MNE subsidiaries' internal embeddedness in innovation performance. Moreover, we explore the moderating influences of external search depth and breadth on subsidiaries' internal knowledge transfer and innovation performance. To test our framework, we rely on primary data collected from 91 subsidiaries of eleven European MNEs. The results show the degree of knowledge transfer from other MNE units mediates the link between subsidiaries' internal embeddedness and their innovation performance. We also find that external search depth positively moderates the link between the degree of knowledge transfer and subsidiary's innovation performance, while external search breadth does not. We illustrate that knowledge transfer mechanisms and the moderating role of external search approaches can be instrumental in channeling and effectively realizing the role of subsidiary internal embeddedness in innovation performance.

AB Purpose The combination of different knowledge sources has been considered conducive for innovation performance. While the literature has advanced regarding the combination of knowledge inputs as in internal and external research and development (R&D), the evolvement of knowledge blend from customers and competitors has also received substantial attention. The purpose of this paper is to delineate the sources of information from the customers into private and public and examine their direct effect on firm-level innovation. While the extant literature is mixed regarding this, no clear-cut results have emerged yet on the effect of knowledge combination from the private and public customers with internal R&D and human capital on innovation activities. This study, however, shed more lights on the inconclusiveness of the effect of knowledge diversity on firm-level innovation. Design/methodology/approach Using the microdata from the German Community Innovation Survey 2013, the authors employ a binary instrumental variable treatment model with Heckman selection, a suitable strategy to estimate binary variables to cope with a possible endogeneity issue. Findings The paper demonstrates that knowledge from customers in the private and public sector, and competitors are positively and significantly associated with innovation. The authors find evidence of a positive and significant effect of the combination of firm internal knowledge competencies with information from the public sector. In contrary, the blend of knowledge competencies with information from customers in the private sector and information from the competitors results in decline to innovation. The results also show that the blend of internal R&D with knowledge source from the customers in the public sector appears to have a stronger influence in the manufacturing sector than services. The results offer strong evidence of the positive link between knowledge diversity and firm-level innovation performance. Practical implications - The results have significant managerial implications on the role of the blend of different sources of information in supporting a compelling internal knowledge development to optimise innovation performance. Originality/value This study is foremost to focus on knowledge sources from the customers in the public and private sector and its relationship with R&D and human capital in supporting a successful introduction of innovation.

AB Firms increasingly transcend the boundaries of regional innovation systems in their search for technology and complementary capabilities, and only rarely can they build their knowledge bases on science system output alone. Whereas the former decouple firms from regional user- producer networks, the latter raises important questions concerning the role of local science and education system actors in industrial development. By applying the "modes of innovation" concept on a Norwegian region, this paper discusses how science and education institutions can respond to the challenges of knowledge base complexity and globalization. It concludes that such institutions may play a vital role in supporting knowledge-based development, albeit different from that of academic knowledge exploration followed by linear technology transfer to industry.

AB The adoption of open innovation does not guarantee technological innovation. Many companies have nonetheless implemented open innovation, but success and failure are repeated in the process leading to product innovation performance. In this study, the important elements of technological collaboration, a representative type of open innovation, that can affect product innovation performance were investigated. Also, a structural equation was used to verify the technological collaboration strategy required by the Korean manufacturing industry. In particular, the perspectives on the necessities of anterior knowledge exchange activities and appropriate appropriability mechanisms were considered. The verification results of this study were as follows. First, anterior knowledge exchange activities had a positive effect on the subsequent technological collaboration and product innovation performance, and it was found that science, technology, and innovation (STI)-based knowledge was more effective. Second, increased doing, using, and interacting (DUI)-based knowledge exchange activity resulted in diminished STI-based knowledge effectiveness. Third, the application of informal appropriability mechanisms contributed positively to both technological collaboration and product innovation performance. Based on the verification results of this study, the strategic direction for maximising technological collaboration and product innovation performance was presented for Korean manufacturing companies.

AB Regional innovation systems (RISs) literature has emphasized the critical role of interactive learning and knowledge exchange amongst firms and a variety of spatially connected innovation institutions as the foundation of regional innovation. Knowledge intermediaries have been analysed in terms of the technology-transaction services they provide firms and/or knowledge producers such as universities and therefore the role they play in facilitating interaction within the RIS. However, innovation also depends on the capability of the firm to learn. Some studies have suggested that intermediaries also play a role in that regard as participation in intermediary knowledge transfer programmes can contribute to the development of firm capabilities for problem-solving and learning. Our research is based on two case study intermediary programmes involving interviews with facilitators and participants. Our data show that knowledge intermediaries affect organizational learning capabilities by impacting on firms' network relationships, internal and external communication channels and internal learning processes which in turn affect the ability to interpret and use knowledge within the firm. This suggests that the role of knowledge intermediaries might be greater than facilitating interactions in the innovation system, as knowledge intermediation may affect the ability of firms to learn and absorb knowledge from their environment.

AB In a previous issue of Knowledge Management Research & Practice (KMRP), we analysed the content and keywords of all articles published in the first decade of KMRP. With this article, we extend our preliminary analysis to the citation and co-citations made by these articles. The study covers all the 256 articles published. The most cited article was A dynamic theory of organisational knowledge creation by Nonaka. The most cited KMRP article was by Nonaka and Toyama: The knowledge-creating theory revisited: knowledge creation as a synthesizing process. The co-citation analysis of the 100 most cited articles in KMRP publications showed that four groups of topics emerged, one around communities and situated learning, the second group around networks, knowledge transfer and research methods, a third group around the foundations of knowledge management and a fourth group around intellectual capital.

AB We propose that searching for and transferring knowledge across divisions in a diversified firm can cultivate innovation. Using a sample of 211,636 patents from 1,644 companies during the period 1985-96, we find that the use of interdivisional knowledge positively affects the impact of an invention on subsequent technological developments. Furthermore, the positive effect of the use of interdivisional knowledge on the impact of an invention is stronger than the effect of using knowledge from within divisional boundaries or from outside firm boundaries. Our empirical findings have significant implications for the management of knowledge in diversified firms.

AB Many different objects are used by companies to transfer knowledge to globally distributed subsidiaries. However, tapping into the local knowledge of subsidiaries and transforming this into innovation capabilities remains a challenge for many multinational companies. In this paper, we aim to discuss how different approaches to the use of inter-firm objects can affect companies' abilities to obtain the subsidiaries' knowledge and utilise it to different degrees of innovation performance. For this purpose, we adopted a multiple case study approach consisting of ten multinational companies located in Denmark. Our findings show that companies use inter-firm objects to either control the flow of knowledge and subsidiaries' operations, i.e., the static use, or to create the circumstances favouring a collaborative relationship between headquarter and subsidiaries, i.e., the dynamic use. This paper provides a discussion and perspectives of further research concerning the impact of the different use of inter-firm objects on innovation performance.

AB Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to trace the evolution of dynamic capabilities theory in the primal theories of economics and strategic management. Then a comprehensive research framework is proposed to grapple with the dynamics of the contemporary global markets, incorporating the quintessential elements of the theory, i.e. absorptive capability, innovation capability and adoptive capability.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The paper is conceptual in nature. It tries to review various economic systems of the world since 1770s till the present era. It also evaluates various theories of international business against dynamic capabilities theory and thus proposes various propositions for future empirical testing.
   Findings
   The study has delineated various theories tracing in them the roots of dynamic capabilities. Capitalism, communism and socialism is explained to reach the present state of world economy. Various theories such as the theory of creative destruction, transaction-cost approach, resource-based view and knowledge-based view of the firm have been elaborated to identify their features and shortcomings. Finally, the contemporary theory of dynamic capabilities has been elucidated to integrate the shortcomings of the previous theories. A research framework has also been proposed to overcome the recent criticism of the dynamic capabilities theory of having under-specified constructs.
   Originality/value
   Very few studies have elaborated various economic systems and theories to trace the evolution of dynamic capabilities theory. Thus, this study is original in nature and the proposed research model is also novel which induces further empirical evidence as proposed by the authors.

AB This paper investigates whether multinational companies possess superior manufacturing knowledge relative to domestic companies operating in emerging market countries. Manufacturing knowledge is operationalized as knowledge in use through the implementation and performance impact of manufacturing practices. Using survey data of 216 manufacturing plants located in five emerging countries, we apply analysis of variance (ANOVA) and structural equation modelling (SEM) to identify the potential knowledge surplus of multinational subsidiaries over local companies. Results of our analysis show that, generally, multinational subsidiaries invest significantly more effort in implementing manufacturing practices. Nevertheless, their knowledge superiority concerning the effective use of these practices is only materialized in terms of practices related to human resource development and advanced manufacturing technologies.

AB Knowledge sharing is a fundamental source of competitive advantage. Social networks are thought to play an important role in knowledge sharing, but are presumed to create a trade-off such that a network can be optimized to promote either knowledge seeking or knowledge transfer, but not both. The trade-off, however, is premised on, and representative of a broader tendency to treat, brokerage and closure as contradictory network forms. We challenge this assertion and propose a theory of knowledge sharing with brokerage and closure as compatible and complementary. Evidence from a contract research and development firm broadly supports our theory. We also report the results of a simulation analysis, which illustrate that only in the extremely rare case when a network is characterized by nearly complete balance do brokerage and closure begin to create a trade-off.

AB The Management International Review (MIR) celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2020. In commemoration of this event, we use a bibliometric analysis to present a retrospective on the journal by analyzing its content for the years between 2006 and 2020. We find that the collaboration culture in MIR has risen over time with the increase in the median size of author teams. Moreover, the collaboration network has become more global over time. The methodology used in the journal is predominantly empirical and quantitative with archival data sources most commonly used. The bibliographic coupling of the MIR corpus reveals that the major themes in the journal revolve around "culture," "emerging economies," "innovation, knowledge transfer, and absorptive capacity," "internationalization process," "culture and entry modes," and "internationalization and performance." A comparison with other leading international business journals provides distinct pathways in which MIR may continue to grow. Finally, it is important to note that while the share of conceptual studies has decreased significantly in the last 15 years, the MIR editors want to see more novel and theoretically grounded conceptual articles in the journal.

AB Replication strategies rely on the exploration of new knowledge. An important source of new knowledge is the transfer of unit level experience to headquarters, a process referred to as reverse knowledge flows. Such knowledge flows are fraught with difficulty as formal mechanisms often break down due to diverging business interests of unit and headquarters managers. This study brings together research on knowledge stickiness and autonomous action to provide a new avenue for understanding reverse knowledge flows. By drawing on an exploratory study of a franchise network, we provide an insight into how autonomous action reduces initiation stickiness but potentially increases implementation stickiness. Our analysis suggests that the role of autonomous action for reverse knowledge flows is moderated by unit managers' resource expectations that emerge as a result of autonomous action. Exploring the interplay of autonomous action and knowledge stickiness provides new explanatory means for understanding reverse knowledge flows in replicator organizations.

AB This paper aims at investigating organizational mechanisms through which firms involved in open innovation initiatives can acquire external knowledge, integrate it with the existing one residing in the diverse functional areas, and transform it into innovation outcomes. Following the knowledge transformation perspective, we use the notions of early-stage and late-stage functional involvement, and explain their mediating effects on a firm's innovation performance. Based on a sample of 131 international firms involved in open innovation projects, we find that high involvement of functions related to the early stage of the innovation process - notably new concept generation, research and development, and design and testing - fully mediates the effect of external knowledge transfer on innovation performance. Similarly, high involvement of functions related to the late stage of the innovation process - notably manufacturing, marketing, distribution, and logistics - has significant indirect effect on innovation performance but lower than that of early-stage functional involvement. Furthermore, the empirical research reveals that early-stage functional involvement mediates the positive effect of external knowledge transfer on late-stage functional involvement. Theoretical and practical implications of our findings are discussed.

AB We draw on a social network perspective to explain multinational enterprises' (MNEs) propensity to distribute their operations unevenly across various regions of the world. We focus on how the positioning of MNEs in their domestic network of strategic alliances affects their geographic scope, i.e., whether they concentrate on their home region or expand beyond it. We theorize that embeddedness in alliance networks constitutes a double-edged sword to the geographic scope of MNEs. Strong embeddedness in domestic alliance networks drives the development of location-bound firm-specific advantages (FSAs), which may narrow down MNEs' geographic scope. In contrast, moderate embeddedness leads to more non-location-bound FSAs, which reduce liability of foreignness, and hence motivate MNEs to widen their geographical scope. We thus predict a non-linear relationship between domestic alliance network embeddedness and MNE geographic scope. Furthermore, the impact of the domestic alliance network on MNE geographic scope hinges on the organizational ability to efficiently and effectively absorb resources stemming from the network. We test our hypotheses using FDI data from 302 US MNEs in the information and communication technology industry for the period of 2001-2008, and generally find robust support for the hypothesized relationships.6

AB Inter-firm social links are always helpful to establish mutual trust for further cooperation, and inter-firm knowledge exchange stresses the relative importance in a technological field. This study first examines the differences and relationships among the networks that are constructed by different exchanged resources, and further explores how a firm's embedded local cluster resources and the brokerages' roles in different inter-firm networks shape a firm's leading position in the technical knowledge field. To construct inter-firm networks, we survey all members in the Taiwan Fastener Industry Association, collecting 87 valid samples for a 67% response rate. We use QAP (Quadratic Assignment Procedure) regressions to examine the relationships among networks, including social network (SN), information network (IN), and knowledge network (KN). We execute a negative binomial regression to investigate the importance of cluster resources and cross-regional brokering roles in SN and IN for gaining a higher position in technical KN. The results first show that the ties in SN and IN help establish cooperative partnerships in exchanging technical knowledge. Second, local cluster resources play a critical role in driving firms to gain a higher position in KN. Third, to have a leading role in KN, the brokerage roles in IN seem to be more important than the brokerages in SN. In particular, cross-regional brokerage roles (e.g., liaison) in IN strengthen their position in KN.

AB Background: Given the current emphasis on networks as vehicles for innovation and change in health service delivery, the ability to conceptualise and measure organisational enablers for the social construction of knowledge merits attention. This study aimed to develop a composite tool to measure the organisational context for evidence-based practice (EBP) in healthcare.
   Methods: A structured search of the major healthcare and management databases for measurement tools from four domains: research utilisation (RU), research activity (RA), knowledge management (KM), and organisational learning (OL). Included studies were reports of the development or use of measurement tools that included organisational factors. Tools were appraised for face and content validity, plus development and testing methods. Measurement tool items were extracted, merged across the four domains, and categorised within a constructed framework describing the absorptive and receptive capacities of organisations.
   Results: Thirty measurement tools were identified and appraised. Eighteen tools from the four domains were selected for item extraction and analysis. The constructed framework consists of seven categories relating to three core organisational attributes of vision, leadership, and a learning culture, and four stages of knowledge need, acquisition of new knowledge, knowledge sharing, and knowledge use. Measurement tools from RA or RU domains had more items relating to the categories of leadership, and acquisition of new knowledge; while tools from KM or learning organisation domains had more items relating to vision, learning culture, knowledge need, and knowledge sharing. There was equal emphasis on knowledge use in the different domains.
   Conclusion: If the translation of evidence into knowledge is viewed as socially mediated, tools to measure the organisational context of EBP in healthcare could be enhanced by consideration of related concepts from the organisational and management sciences. Comparison of measurement tools across domains suggests that there is scope within EBP for supplementing the current emphasis on human and technical resources to support information uptake and use by individuals. Consideration of measurement tools from the fields of KM and OL shows more content related to social mechanisms to facilitate knowledge recognition, translation, and transfer between individuals and groups.

AB Organizational routines are means through which organizations can reutilize best practices and so their replication, i.e., duplicating beneficial routines across context, is a key value-creating strategy. However, it is difficult to map network effects on routine replication. Here, we investigated routine replicating dynamics considering two types of network contexts, namely, (1) connections between different (geographically distributed) units in a decentralized organization and (2) the coupling relation between routines, i.e., a bundle of different routines involved in each unit. By considering routine replication as one kind of template-based activities between different units, we examined interrelations between routines with a NK-based fitness landscape model. Our results show that when there is an appropriate level of absorptive capacities (i.e., when organizations are capable of identifying and acquiring externally generated knowledge), there is an optimal combination of these two types of networks, which is beneficial to routine replicating practices and organization adaptation. Furthermore, we also found that intraorganizational variations, including template-duplicating errors and innovative activities, are instrumental to enhance adaptive changes. Our findings suggest measures to control and manage best practice diffusion across organizations.

AB The study examines how the utilisation of a new performance measurement system (PMS) influences supply chain management (SCM) and what kind of impacts the new system has on the performance of the supply chain. The paper utilises a longitudinal research setting where the data was gathered in two semi-structured interview studies after an action research project in which a new measurement system was designed and developed. The findings show how a PMS serves as a catalyst of inter-organisational knowledge transfer and promotes shared learning. The results also show how knowledge transfer and shared learning led to improved performance of the supply chain. The paper contributes by opening up the practical mechanisms through which performance measurement provides value for SCM and by showing how inter-organisational transfer of performance information catalyses learning and performance improvement. The paper looks beyond the design of performance measures and provides a view on the practice of supply chain performance management. The paper illustrates how sharing performance information amongst supply chain companies improves managers' awareness of shared targets and the status of network operations. This also resulted in improved performance in the studied case network. Overall, the results encourage organisations to engage in network-level performance measurement and share performance information with their network partners.

AB Prior research showed that there is a growing consensus among researchers, which point out a key role of external knowledge sources such as external R&D and technologies in enhancing firms ' innovation. However, firms ' from catching-up Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries have already shown in the past that their innovation models differ from those applied, for example, in Western Europe. This study therefore introduces a novel two-staged model combining artificial neural networks and random forests to reveal the importance of internal and external factors influencing firms ' innovation performance in the case of 3,361 firms from six catching-up CEE countries (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), by using the World Banks ' Enterprise Survey data from 2019. We confirm the hypothesis that innovators in the catching-up CEE countries depend more on internal knowledge sources and, moreover, that participation in the firms groups represents an important factor of firms ' innovation. Surprisingly, we reject the hypothesis that foreign technologies are a crucial source of external knowledge. This study contributes to the theories of open innovation and absorptive capacity in the context of selected CEE countries and provides several practical implications for firms.

AB While there is an extensive body of knowledge on university-industry collaboration (UIC) for technology transfer, two salient gaps remain. First, studies on UIC have predominately focused on situations when the relationship is established based on perceived complementary needs between collaborators. However, research on 'engineered' UIC, or when the collaboration has been triggered and coordinated by a third-party, is still scarce. Second, we lack proper understanding into the micro-foundations of technology transfer process using the lens of social capital (SC). This is a necessary inquiry given the prevailing conception of technology transfer as a socio-technical process. We address these two gaps by investigating the idiosyncrasy of SC in five case studies of the Faraday Partnership Initiative, a UK public-sponsored programme designed to enhance cross-sector technology transfer. As key contributions, we develop a conceptual framework that explains how social capital facilitates technology transfer in engineered UIC. We also advance the debate on academic engagement and commercialization by elaborating how knowledge produced by academics can be transformed into useable forms of technology by distinguishing between technology translation and transfer. The former emerged as a critical element of the latter.

AB Innovation research has not presented an integrated model of how knowledge sources emerging from managers' interpersonal relationships facilitate innovation within new ventures. Further, it remains unclear how such knowledge transfer may be shaped by the advance of digital technologies. This study examines how these knowledge sources and the context of the digital technologies in which they are produced influence the quality of knowledge developed by entrepreneurial ventures. Our results show that parent firm and co-inventor innovativeness significantly impact venture knowledge quality, with this benefit significantly enhanced when parents possess superior information technology systems. We also find that geographically proximate innovations provide similar benefits, though they are mitigated in regions with greater adoption of computer technologies. We test our predictions on a sample of 632 biotechnology ventures founded over a ten-year period, tracking their innovations over a subsequent ten-year period. We contribute to research on entrepreneurship, geographic location, and knowledge creation.

AB Our paper aims to analyse the effects of the networking of the entrepreneur on the innovation capability of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). For this purpose, we examine the mediation of the knowledge management in our business model in the relationship between structural and cognitive features of networking and innovation capability. Our results show, in the specific case of 124 entrepreneurs in North African SMEs, that the networking is concretised by innovation capability in the presence of a partial mediation of the knowledge management for cognitive features, and a full mediation for structural features. The originality of research lies in the formulation of networking-based entrepreneurship model in which the reinforcement of innovation capability of SME is conditioned by knowledge management, which is facilitated by structural and cognitive features of networking.

AB Over the past two decades, the number of international cooperative patents has grown significantly with the development of globalization. Although previous studies have almost exclusively used econometric methods, we argue that international cooperative patents change over time and that the relevant actors are dynamic, connected, and coexist to determine a country's position in the international network of such patents. This study verified that different dimensions in the growth trajectory of the central patent international cooperative network curve form covariance structure perspectives using a latent growth curve model. Additionally, past studies have rarely examined whether technological concentration affects national technology innovation capacities; here, we integrated technological concentration with the estimation model. The results indicated that knowledge stock has a positive effect on the evolutionary growth rate of international cooperative patent network centrality. Moreover, technological concentration was found to strengthen the effect of knowledge stock on network centrality. An experimental map was produced to illustrate the interrelationships of the dimensions, which may be used as a reference by the government.

AB The need to better understand the mechanisms underlying regional growth patterns is widely recognized. This article argues that regional growth is partly a function of the value created through inter-organizational flows of knowledge within and across regions. It is proposed that investment in calculative networks by organizations to access knowledge is a form of capital, termed network capital, which should be incorporated into regional growth models. The article seeks to develop a framework to capture the value of network capital within these models based on the spatial configuration and the nature of the knowledge flowing through networks.

AB This article examines subsidiary-level factors that promote global initiatives in MNCs. Global initiatives are a key capability of MNCs that domestic firms do not possess, yet there has been little research on how MNCs promote initiatives on a global basis. I draw principally on the knowledge-based view to develop a model in which three subsidiary-level variables explain the propensity of the MNC to pursue global initiatives. These variables are: (1) inter-unit networking, (2) subsidiary learning from internal and external sources, (3) shared strategic goals. A survey of 118 subsidiary managers, triangulated with interviews with 20 key informants, provides support for the hypothesized effect of subsidiary learning and shared strategic goals on global initiatives. The result for inter-unit networking is less clear. These variables combine to activate initiatives within the MNC and thus act as a source of competitiveness on a worldwide basis. The results have important implications for MNC managers as well as for theory, and these are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Joining global supply chain networks helps firms to enhance innovation performance as firms need to satisfy various standard requirements from overseas customers. From the global value chain theory, there is no evidence on what types of supply chain ownership structures help firms to achieve more innovation. This deficiency led us to investigate types of supply chain ownership structures, i.e., Pure Domestic Chain, Pure Joint Venture (JV) Chain, Pure Multinational Corporation (MNC) Chain, Export Chain, and Import Chain, that can help firms to achieve more innovation. One-way ANOVA is used to analyze 856 responses collected from the Thai manufacturing industry during 2012-2017. The results indicate that firms in the Pure MNC Chain have the highest levels of product and process innovation. There is less innovation for the Pure JV Chain, Export Chain, Import Chain, and Pure Domestic Chain, in decreasing order. This means that firms in global supply chain networks tend to have better innovation performance than firms in local supply chain networks. The innovation capabilities of local firms can be enhanced through knowledge transfer and knowledge co-creation by joining global supply chain networks.

Our basic assumption is that proximity means a lot more than just geography. The findings from this research broaden our understanding of how start-ups located inside an industrial cluster acquire knowledge from their customers and exploit it in an innovative way, underscoring the need to reconsider assumptions regarding the importance of geographical proximity between business partners during knowledge management.

AB Prior research indicates that entrepreneurs with new ventures should build knowledge networks that grant access to a variety of geographic knowledge sources if they are to enhance their innovative performance. In this article, we explore entrepreneurs' abilities to reap the benefits of the geographical configuration of their knowledge networks. Controlling for a wide range of firm-level factors, we find that a too diverse network geographically speaking, negatively impacts innovative performance. This main effect is, however, positively moderated by entrepreneurs' breadth of prior career experience and their ventures' knowledge integration capability.

AB Evidence-based policy has become rhetoric for many western governments across a broad range of health and social policy areas. However, the transfer and uptake of academic research in policy contexts has often been problematic. Academics frequently argue that policy makers ignore the research they produce, while policy makers argue that academic research is seldom relevant to their needs. Research relationships and collaborations have long been regarded as key strategies to create pathways for research into policy contexts. They are also understood to better support the application of research in understanding policy issues, and in designing and implementing policy initiatives. This paper reports on findings from a large scale project, which targeted public servants undertaking policy work in Australian federal and state departments to investigate their experiences around the availability and use of academic social research. The paper explores the relevance of networks and linkages between academics and public servants in supporting research transfer and uptake. Reported barriers and facilitators to linkages are outlined. The paper concludes that a research-informed understanding of the factors and processes that promote and prevent effective linkages between academics and policy officials is needed to develop more realistic efforts to address the research/policy gap.

AB The purpose of this paper is to empirically analyze the determinants of foreign subsidiary's local embeddedness because it is critically important for the subsidiary to build a variegated local network. This paper suggests that a MNC's global capability, the degree of autonomy granted by the headquarters of the multinational corporation to its foreign subsidiary, the foreign subsidiary's absorptive capacity based on local environment, and its level of localization will affect the subsidiary's local network embeddedness. The empirical analysis confirmed that when the headquarters gives the foreign subsidiary more autonomy, this has a positive effect on the local embeddedness of the foreign subsidiary and when the foreign subsidiary has a strong absorptive capacity, this has a positive correlation with the local embeddedness of the foreign subsidiary. And this paper found that when the foreign subsidiary has achieved a high level of staff localization, this foreign subsidiary will have a higher level of local embeddedness. This study identified the preceding conditions necessary for a foreign subsidiary of a multinational corporation to effectively embed itself in the local network by analyzing factors related to the multinational corporation's headquarters and subsidiaries, and thus contributes significantly to continued research on the local embeddedness of subsidiaries.

AB Innovation determines a firm's competitiveness and survival and a joint venture is a fast and effective way to acquire the missing knowledge that partners require to innovate, but 'knowing how to cooperate' can be a determining factor in achieving the successful transfer of knowledge. Employing a sample of 81 service-sector firms and using a structural equation modeling methodology, we found a positive and direct impact between the cooperative learning process and partners' commitment to innovation.

AB In this study, we seek to advance the network perspective on new venture internationalization by examining the role of networks in accelerating new venture sales into foreign markets. We propose that knowledge derived from ventures' technology and marketing alliances increases the likelihood that new ventures begin exploiting opportunities in international markets. We also argue that the extent to which the networks open the venture to new knowledge or constrain it to knowledge already shared among the partners will influence the initiation of foreign sales by a venture. Using a longitudinal dataset of 118 ventures in the U.S. biotechnology industry, we confirm that different types of alliances (and, therefore, different types of knowledge-technology and marketing knowledge) differentially impact the likelihood of new venture internationalization. Moreover, network cohesion among venture alliances increases the likelihood that marketing alliances will promote initial foreign market sales, but decreases the likelihood that technology alliances will do so. Our research is a timely response to a call for the study of interactive effects among network structure, complex tasks, and time, and it provides a possible explanation for certain unexpected findings in studies that did not consider the effects of time.

AB We conceptualize international assignees as informational boundary spanners between multinational enterprise units, and develop a cross-level model that explores how assignees' social capital translates into inter-unit intellectual capital. First, as knowledge brokers, assignees create inter-unit intellectual capital by linking their home- and host-unit social capital, thereby enabling cross-unit access to previously unconnected knowledge resources. Second, as knowledge transmitters, assignees' host-unit social capital facilitates their creation of individual intellectual capital, which, in turn, translates into inter-unit intellectual capital. We conclude that individual social capital needs to be explicitly transferred to the organizational level to have a sustained effect on inter-unit intellectual capital.

AB In face of the rapidly changing environment and unpredictability of tourist hotels as well as rising consumer needs, constant learning is necessary for tourist hotels to maintain the competitive advantage and survival. Continuous learning is therefore required for organizations and individuals in tourist hotels; however, the learning levels and types are distinct. To enhance the international competitiveness, a tourist hotel has to effectively absorb, transfer, and even create new knowledge for the effective innovation. For this reason, "organizational learning" and "knowledge creation" become the keys in the future research on innovation. Total 360 copies are distributed, and 304 valid copies are retrieved, with the retrieval rate 84%. The research results are concluded as below. 1) Organizational learning shows significantly positive correlations with knowledge creation. 2) Knowledge creation reveals remarkably positive correlations with organization innovation. 3) Organizational learning presents notably positive correlations with organization innovation. 4) Knowledge creation appears mediation on the relationship between organizational learning and organization innovation. Finally, suggestions, according to the research results, are proposed, expecting to enhance the market share and profitability of tourist hotels and to maintain the sustainable management and development.

AB Purpose - Considerable attention has been paid to the motives and process of idiosyncratic internationalization trajectory of Multinational Corporations from emerging economies (EMNCs). Yet, the ability to undertake strategic asset-seeking foreign direct investments (FDIs) is not the same as the ability to achieve subsequent investment success (Buckley, 2018). Since an ultimate goal of strategic asset-seeking FDIs is to tap advanced knowledge in host locations to accelerate EMNC competence creation, and the current study aims to shed light on the question of whether, and if so how, EMNCs have been able to build competences after strategic asset-seeking motivated FDIs.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study tests the US patent and citation data from 2000 to 2014 of leading innovation-oriented MNCs from China and India, complemented with data from LexisNexis Directory of Corporate Affiliations and Mergent Online databases. Wilcoxon rank sum test is employed to compare EMNCs with control group MNCs from mature industrialized countries to identify key technological competence creation mechanisms of EMNCs. Negative binomial regression technique is then employed to test the relationship between the key mechanisms and EMNC innovative performance in terms of quantity and quality of patented inventions.
   Findings - In contrast to the extant EMNC literature, the author finds that EMNC parents adopt a hands-on and less of an orchestrating approach. They are playing critical roles in accessing and transferring knowledge from international host locations. The empirical analyses indicate an absence of reverse transfers of knowledge from subsidiaries to the parent. Instead, EMNC parents directly access and absorb explicit knowledge from external sources in subsidiary host locations, which significantly contributes to EMNC innovative performance. Meanwhile, the author finds that the employment of intra-firm and inter-unit inventor teams and associated internal tacit knowledge access and transfer significantly contribute to EMNC innovative performance.
   Originality/value - This study investigates the post-internationalization performance of EMNCs and contributes to the reconciliation of theoretical debates, as well as the generation of a comprehensive understanding of the MNC. Managerial implications are also discussed.

AB Current theories of how organizations harness knowledge for innovative activity cannot convincingly explain emergent practices whereby firms selectively reveal knowledge to their advantage. We conceive of selective revealing as a strategic mechanism to reshape the collaborative behavior of other actors in a firm's innovation ecosystem. We propose that selective revealing may provide an effective alternative to known collaboration mechanisms, particularly under conditions of high partner uncertainty, high coordination costs, and unwilling potential collaborators. We specify conditions when firms are more likely to reveal knowledge and highlight some boundary conditions for competitor reciprocity. We elaborate on strategies that allow firms to exhibit managerial agency in selective revealing and discuss selective revealing's implications for theories of organization and open innovation and for management practice.

AB We study knowledge flows between organizations through secondments, shortterm employee assignments at an organization different from the home institution. Secondments allow the sending organization to capture knowledge and network resources from the receiving organization without an organization-level contract, alliance, or colocation, a process we term learning by seconding. We focus on the National Science Foundation (NSF) rotation program, under which the NSF employs academics, called rotators, on loan from their university, to lead peer reviews. We ask how rotators affect the behavior of their academic colleagues after returning from a secondment. Using difference in differences estimations, we show that rotators' colleagues raise considerably more research funds than similar scientists who do not have a rotator colleague. Additional quantitative and qualitative evidence implies that the treatment effect occurs via knowledge transfer, as rotators help generate ideas, frame proposals, and explain processes, rather than rent-seeking on the part of the rotator. Overall, the results suggest that strong ties and shared social identity play an important role in organizational knowledge acquisition.

AB In this paper, we aim at providing a critical appraisal of academic research valorisation models adopted in three regions in the world: the Provincia di Milano in Italy, the Technology-Region Karlsruhe in Germany and the Chinese municipality of Chongqing
   Our first originality consists in developing a literature-based analytical grid to characterise and classify existing tools. In a second step, we depict and compare, thanks to a qualitative analysis run on fine-grained data (collected through in depth interviews and frequent interactions with actors of the regional innovation systems), the mechanisms adopted in the three regions so as to test for specificities in the implementation of academic knowledge transfer.
   Our analysis exhibits on the one hand a strong similarity among regions in terms of variety of existing tools On the other hand, we also notice some specificities in the nature of the tools European regions are characterised by an under-representation of absorption and appropriation tools, whereas the Chinese region seems to put great stress on direct valorisation mechanisms. Finally, rather than supporting the imitation, multiplication and superposition of newly created tools, our study encourages policy makers to be more selective and adapt their tools to regional innovative needs.

AB China has taken a foreign direct investment-based approach toward increasing its capital and knowledge base, and developing into an innovative economy. However, little quantitative evidence exists about the factors that drive innovations of foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs) there. This paper uses survey data from high-technology firms in Shanghai to discuss factors affecting their innovativeness. It takes the concepts of absorptive capacity, export orientation, and innovation-related cooperation as a starting point. It highlights how the interplay of strategies and resources affects innovativeness and heterogeneity of FIEs. The most innovative FIEs are endowed with a strong human capital base and R&D activities, which at the same time target export markets and whose cooperative partners involve firms other than their parent company. The results underline the necessity to differentiate between the different types of FIEs when examining their innovativeness.

AB If innovation is the engine of economies, the partnerships in the Triple Helix model of innovation are the fuel that makes this engine work. Although each member of this model has its defined role, the present study sought to gain a new perspective on these partnerships, including the role of governments. Based on interviews with representatives of universities, companies, and governments in two countries (i.e., Portugal and Spain), this research focused on how innovation partnerships are formed as well as what obstacles to cooperation can arise. The results show that governments can play the role not only of a financier and legislator but also of a direct participant in innovation by entering into partnerships with the other Triple Helix actors. In addition, this study revealed that, irrespective of which partners and needs are in question, these networks operate mostly with public funds.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine how professional service firms (PSFs) manage the linguistic tensions between global Englishization and local multilingualism. It achieves this by analysing the work of Big Four audit firms in Luxembourg, where three official languages co-exist: Luxembourgish, French, and German. In addition, expatriates bring with them their native languages in a corporate environment that uses English as its lingua franca.
   Design/methodology/approach The paper combines the institutionalist sociology of the professions with theoretical concepts from sociolinguistics to study the multifaceted role of language in PSFs. Empirically, the paper draws from 25 interviews with current and former audit professionals.
   Findings The client orientation of the Big Four segments each firm into language teams based on the client's language. It is thus the client languages, rather than English as the corporate language, that mediate, define, and structure intra- and inter-organizational relationships. While the firms emphasize the benefits of their linguistic adaptability, the paper reveals tensions along language lines, suggesting that language can be a means of creating cohesion and division within the firms.
   Originality/value This paper connects research on PSFs with that on the role of language in multinational organizations. In light of the Big Four's increasingly global workforce, it draws attention to the linguistic divisions within the firms that question the existence of a singular corporate culture. While prior literature has centred on firms' global-local divide, the paper shows that even single branches of such firm networks are not monolithic constructs, as conflicts and clashes unfold amid a series of local-local divides.

AB Multinational corporations (MNCs) need to sense, source, and mobilize knowledge when and where it arises, whether at home, or elsewhere in the world. For this reason, MNCs benefit from employee networks of relationships that span across intraorganizational barriers, allowing for the efficient mobilization of knowledge across boundaries. Yet, which organizational members are more likely to be able to develop these boundary spanning networks? We leverage a unique data set from a large multinational corporation to empirically test a comprehensive model that captures the effect of an employee's mandate, expertise, and behavioral orientations on her likelihood to span intraorganizational boundaries that manifest themselves in the form of hierarchies, intra-functional domains, and geographic territories. We find that the employees that are more likely to be boundary spanners are those having mandates with a global impact, high levels of expertise, and a collaborative orientation in their networking behaviors. In addition, we find that these effects are stronger for those employees that have large formal workflow networks.

This paper studies the time delay between scientific research and technology patents, and focuses on the key components of time in the promotion of knowledge transformation. Based on United States Patent and Trademark Office patent data, we apply periodical citation distribution models to the patent process. The results show that our transfer function model is better than others, and is suitable for calculating the delay between basic scientific research activities and technology patents.

AB This paper theoretically analyses the effects of innovation cluster on R&D cooperation outcome in terms of private R&D investments. We develop a two-stage strategic R&D game with a duopoly in an innovation cluster. The two firms first conduct cooperatively their R&D decisions in a research joint venture (RJV) before competing in Cournot fashion on the market product. The results show that an innovation cluster improves private R&D investments and social welfare through informational incentives. Then, belonging to an innovation cluster strengthens the willingness to cooperate in R&D and partnership. However, the model also show that innovation clusters can lead to a risk of monopolisation of the market that could be extended even beyond cooperation; this risk thus makes it possible to relativise the expected positive effects of innovation cluster policy on R&D cooperation.

AB The position of a firm in inter-organizational networks that occur in geographic clusters can affect innovation. This study analyzes a wide range of ties and how they impact on the transmission of tacit and explicit knowledge. Thus, a firm's position influences its innovative performance in different ways, according to the type of network-tacit or explicit-and the type of innovation-process or product-under analysis. Few empirical studies have analyzed the relation between social networks and innovation in mature geographic clusters; an appropriate context bearing in mind the contingent nature of the relations under study. The results support the idea that a central position in both tacit and explicit knowledge networks is especially significant in the case of product innovation, but that the influence of structural holes is weaker. These findings contribute to the literature on clusters and social networks by explaining how strategic management of positions in knowledge networks can improve the innovative performance of a firm.

AB This article explores the gap within the extant literature regarding the effectiveness of innovation networks comprising small firms and public research organisations (PROs). By integrating the knowledge-based view, relational view and social capital approach, the article analyses innovation-driven dyadic networks involving SMEs and PROs. Through a multiple case-study method, an examination was undertaken of the structural, relational and cognitive configuration of networks. The study found a co-evolution path between the life-cycle of the relationship, mechanisms of governance and innovation objectives; the existence of a risk of inertial trust' and a need to overlap basic' knowledge bases and develop shared languages.

The aim of the paper is to identify the thematic communities present in the literature dealing with the university-business relationship, with emphasis on the focuses of interest of this literature and on the currently emerging themes. For this purpose, social network analysis and text mining tools were used. The present contribution is distinguished from other reviews by the use of large volumes of data that made it possible to observe aggregate trends in scientific production. Six thematic communities were detected in the literature: technology parks, entrepreneurial university, triple helix, transfer channels, geographical perspective and open innovation. Once these communities were determined, the characteristics of each of them were identified, as well as their linkages, differences and limitations, in order to understand the processes of knowledge transfer.

AB This article investigates the location strategies of Canadian and Chinese multisite firms in international and domestic investment decisions at the metropolitan level. By integrating research from international business studies and economic geography, we combine knowledge-based understandings of multinational corporations and industrial clusters to develop propositions regarding the location strategies of multisite firms in cluster networks. It is argued that firms from clusters are more likely to adopt knowledge strategies than firms from other areas and that they tend to choose cluster locations that are specialized in the same or similar industries to achieve their knowledge goals - both in domestic and international investment decisions. We establish and analyze a database of 3500 investment cases within and between Canada and China to test our propositions. The results show that firms in knowledge-intensive industrial environments with substantial business experience are especially inclined to direct their investments to clusters. Consistent with our emphasis of the subnational as opposed to the national scale, we find that cluster-of-origin effects are more important than country-of-origin effects in explaining firms' investment choices in clusters. These findings support the idea that multisite firms, particularly MNEs, leverage local knowledge pools by strategically locating affiliates across clusters.

AB Recent studies have called for a better understanding of the link between networking and entrepreneurial performance. We provide such understanding in three ways: by focusing on a specific entrepreneurial context (franchise systems), by developing a multi-faceted theoretical framework and by highlighting a contingency that may affect the networking-performance link. We combine knowledge and learning perspectives with a networking perspective to develop and test a multi-faceted framework on the effects of franchisee networking with peers within a franchise system ('peer networking') on franchisee unit performance. In particular, we argue that the performance benefits that franchisees draw from networking with their peers vary between low, medium and high performing franchisees. We use ordinary least squares (OLS) and Quantile Regression analyses to test our hypotheses with empirical data from a Dutch franchise system. Our results confirm that structural, resource and relational facets of franchisee peer networking affect unit performance, and that they benefit and harm low, medium, and high performing franchisees differently.

AB Although cluster research has been an enormously vivid field in the past years, the idea that firms' individual competences influence the knowledge gain from collocation is still under-researched. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap in two steps. First, we derive four firm-specific cluster competences from existing literature as key components of a T-shaped model which is based on the resource and the relational view on knowledge spillovers. Second, we evaluate the explanatory power of our model in terms of firm success by conducting empirical testing on the basis of several logistic regressions in the form of proportional odds models. For this purpose, we use a hitherto unexploited firm-level data set, gained from a survey conducted among small and medium-sized craft businesses in Germany. The results provide evidence that idiosyncratic cluster competences on the firm level are supportive of firm success in business clusters.

AB Existing research on international licensing focuses on firm decisions related to the choice of licensing versus alternative modes of entry into foreign markets, the timing of licensing within the technology life cycle, and appropriate compensation structures to collect rents. This paper complements and extends this stream of research by focusing on decisions related to granting exclusive licensing rights to a technology in foreign markets.
   The decision surrounding licensing exclusivity is based on the consideration of monopoly rents, technology transfer costs and transaction costs.
   Factors related to the nature of the technology being licensed, the foreign market environment in which it is licensed, and the characteristics of licensor and licensee firms are likely to influence the choice between exclusive and non-exclusive licensing in a particular foreign market.
   Propositions developed in the paper incorporate the direct and interaction effects of these three set of variables in predicting exclusivity decisions in international technology licensing.

AB The debate on the industry-science cooperation has raised questions about what determines the successful interactions and their impact on a firm's innovation performance. This paper discusses the relevance of traditional hypotheses on the relationship between industry and science to developing countries using the evidence from Russian manufacturing. We distinguish between several modes of cooperation (new-to-market innovation, new-to-firm innovation, acquisition of non-R&D services) and investigate a broad range of determinants, including competition regime, absorptive capacity, technological opportunities, appropriability conditions and public support. Our findings illustrate that in less-developed national innovation systems with below average levels of technological opportunity, the industry-science link is influenced more by the specificity of economic activity, firm size and maturity than a result of higher firm-level innovation effort. Public support should be specifically tailored to promote networking with R&D organizations and universities and must consider expanding the focus to account for non-R&D based cooperative activities.

AB This paper aims at developing a theoretical framework that explains levels of interactive learning. Interactive learning is defined as the exchange and sharing of knowledge resources conducive to innovation between an innovator firm, its suppliers, and/or its customers. Our research question is: Why do levels of interactive learning of innovator firms, their customers, and/or suppliers vary? Our theoretical framework combines a resource-based perspective with an activity-based account of interactive learning. It starts with a resource-based argument, which is specified by introducing competing and complementary theoretical arguments such as the complexity and structuring of innovative activities, and sectoral technological dynamics. The strength of internal knowledge resources can either hamper or facilitate levels of interactive learning. We assume that more complex innovative activities urge firms to co-ordinate and exchange information between users and producers, which implies a higher level of interactive learning. The structuring of innovative activities, as well as sectoral technological dynamics can foster interactive learning.
   To test our theoretical claims, we estimated six models predicting the level of interactive learning of innovator firms with: (1) their customers (here the innovating firms are the producers); (2) their suppliers there the innovating firms are the customers); (3) with customers and suppliers split by size (four separate models). These analyses allow a comparison of the antecedents of interactive learning of innovator firms performing dual roles, and having a different size. Both monotonic and non-monotonic effects of the complexity of innovative activities, the strength of the internal knowledge base, and monotonic effects of the structuring of innovative activities are tested.
   Our findings suggest that our theoretical model best fits the interactive learning of small- and medium-sized innovator firms. Interactive learning with customers is positively associated with the complexity and structuring of innovative activities, and with moderate scores of the cross-product term of 'complexity of innovative activities and the strength of knowledge resources'. Interactive learning with customers is positively affected by higher technological dynamics. Stronger internal knowledge resources yield positive effects on interactive learning with suppliers up to a threshold point. Once this threshold is crossed, the effects of stronger knowledge resources become negative. Interactive learning with suppliers as well as with customers is positively associated with internal and external structuring of innovative activities, but is not affected by sectoral technological dynamics.

AB Subsidiaries of manufacturing companies operate as members of two distinct networks: the internal manufacturing network of the company and the external network of supply chain partners. Adapting the concept of "dual embeddedness" from international business literature to a manufacturing context, this paper proposes a model explaining the link between internal integration, external integration and operational performance. An international survey containing data on 470 manufacturing subsidiaries is used to operationalize the constructs. Structural equation modeling provides evidence for a full mediation model: external integration mediates the positive impact of internal integration on performance. Based on the results, it is put forward that knowledge generated within the internal manufacturing network can only be converted into subsidiary-level operational performance, if it is shared and recombined with external supply chain partners. The highest performance benefits can only be achieved if both suppliers and customers are involved in this process. A limitation of our approach is that knowledge flows are measured indirectly by assessing the level of integration of a subsidiary in the knowledge flows within the internal network, and the level of integration with suppliers and customers.

AB The paper aims to support regional policy-makers who seek to understand the determinants of regional innovation dynamics. The challenge is to penetrate the black box of the Regional Innovation System (RIS) by identifying the building blocks and interaction processes that stimulate innovation at the regional level. Thanks to a creative database, the main originality of this study is to analyse regional innovation as a process of competences building. To test this explanatory model, a knowledge production function is estimated at the regional level in France by using a simultaneous equations setting. Our results validate the systemic dimension of regional innovation and identify the most valuate input-output transmission mechanisms.

AB The correct use of information technology (IT) in business is a longstanding critical issue due to the competitive advantages and performance that IT generates when it is managed strategically and correctly aligned with a business' strategies and processes. A conceptual model is presented to investigate the effects of intangible assets and organizational capabilities on business-IT strategic alignment. Social networks between business and IT executives conform to relational capital that permits the creation of combinative capabilities; these capabilities encourage the transfer, integration, learning, and strategic use of business and IT executives' knowledge, and affect the level of strategic business-IT alignment. This combination of social-network characteristics and organizational capabilities in order to generate strategic business-IT alignment is new.

AB Clusters have the potential to strengthen firm innovation. However, our knowledge of how firms are affected by the external resources found in clusters, and how this relates to their level of internal resources, is limited. There are seemingly conflicting theoretical assumptions and empirical findings on both the individual and combined impact of these resources. Our paper seeks to reconcile these by adopting a configurational lens, allowing for multiple pathways to innovation. Applying fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) to a sample of firms in European aerospace clusters, we uncover that innovation outcomes can only be explained through combinations of internal assets, and external resources provided by geography, networks, and institutions. No single resource, in isolation, is sufficient. We distinguish between a total of seven pathways. These vary from weak firms benefitting from localized knowledge spillovers, to strong firms with extensive non-local networks. We find that the relationship between internal and external resources is causally complex, with even the potential for negative innovation impacts. Hence, we provide a first step towards harmonizing the literature's different approaches to understanding clusters' impact on firms.

AB Purpose The authors' main objective is to examine the resource alteration underlying the digital manufacturing transformation. The authors rely on the adaptation aspect of dynamic capabilities (DC) theory and their analysis shows how and why a factory adapts its resources and capabilities during digital transformation. Design/methodology/approach To grasp the change, the authors apply the longitudinal case study method within a revelatory case setting. The digital transformation is detailed from the perspective of a subsidiary that has played a key role in the division's digital transformation. Findings Analysing the revealed four stages of the transformation through the lenses of the DC components of adaptation (sensing capability, absorptive capacity, integrative capability, relational capability), this study suggests a sequence with unbalanced characteristics. Each stage starts with sensing capability, each component appears during each stage and each stage is dominated by a different component. Relying on the path dependency concept, the authors also present that the interplay between lean as an old resource stock and digital manufacturing as a new resource stock is rather a necessity, especially at the beginning of the transformation (at a corporation that pursues lean for years). Practical implications Digital strategy development is rather an intermediate element of the transformation, since committed personnel (or maybe their network) start bottom-up and coordinate initiatives as they sense the opportunities in the environment. Top managers should rely on their accumulated knowledge and involve them into the transfer coalition in the top-down phase of digitalization. The authors' case also underlines that starting to experiment with novel technologies requires a solid (and usually expensive) technological and human basis. Finally, process improvement focussed developments at a high-performing factory might be just enough to deal with ever-demanding customer expectations. Originality/value This study is among the firsts in operations management that relies on the DC theory to follow up the digital transformation of a factory. A further valuable contribution is that the adaptation process is examined in a longitudinal case study.

AB This article addresses the question of how the emergence of a cluster in a global innovation system is influenced by early entrants. It does so by presenting an explorative study of the emerging digital creative industries cluster in Bangalore. I find that MNE entrants develop production and technological capabilities comparatively fast within a narrow range of value chain activities with limited spillovers to the cluster. In comparison, local entrants develop such capabilities more slowly, but within a broader range of value chain activities and with higher spillovers of skills and knowledge, as well as higher participation to building a local entrepreneurial ecosystem. I propose that these effects are moderated by the size of national consumer markets as well as industry context in the guise of project lengths and technological modularity. I also point to the role of global connectivity, proposing that local entrants, in particular, leverage international personal relationships for development of not only relational, but also production capabilities.

AB In the last few years, Russia has supported the establishment of cluster initiatives to strengthen economic development, open channels for knowledge transfer, raise the national technology base, and integrate domestic manufacturing more prominently into global value chains. This paper studies 25 pilot cluster initiatives which received financial support within the national programme. The analysis shows that privately funded initiatives tend to use the cluster format as an efficient way to organize economic activities. Publicly funded cluster initiatives, in contrast, are more likely to engage in R&D partnerships with institutes in technologically advanced regions, such as Western Europe or South-East Asia, and thereby act as transfer channels to strengthen the region's technology base. Also, industries that build on analytical knowledge are more likely to engage in partnerships than industries that use local and tacit knowledge. Still, the cluster management organizations struggle greatly to appoint adequately skilled staff and to cope with limited financial resources, as these are the biggest barriers for cluster internationalization, while cultural differences and geographical distance were of much less importance.

AB Previous literature has focused on either the direct or indirect contribution of cultural and creative industries (CCI) firms to the innovation capability of the wider economy, while the reverse approach, that is, the effect of region on CCI firms' innovation, has been completely neglected. In this paper, it is argued that the innovative performance of CCI firms with an academic origin (CCI-USOs) may be influenced by the regional context where they operate. In so doing, it is defended that the study of innovation in CCI firms can be advanced through the development of a more integrative framework. Relying on a sample of 92 Spanish CCI-USOs over the period 2001-2010 and applying multilevel modelling, this study sheds light on how regional and firm level factors simultaneously impact on CCI-USOs' innovation. The findings show that the regional context determines the innovative performance of CCI-USOs. In addition, firm age has a negative effect on the probability of having patent activity, while firm size and venture capital exerts a positive influence on innovative performance. On the basis of these results, some policies for fostering innovation in CCIs are proposed.

AB Purpose - Social capital plays an important role in transforming knowledge within and across inter-firm business networks in industries. The purpose of this paper is to explore different kinds of transfer mechanism such as "bonding," "bridging," and "protecting" within a case network of the Danish offshore windmill industry. Its aim is to describe how these mechanisms interactively support value co-creation among the involved enterprises and how social capital, residing in the relationships between actors from the firms, is influenced by the different transfer mechanisms.
   Design/methodology/approach - Based upon a single case study, the paper demonstrates "bonding," "bridging," and "protecting" as distinct, yet related, mechanisms for inter-firm business networking. The sample used covers selected key actors from the network as well as third-party experts from the Danish windmill industry, which together represent the most important knowledge-offering and knowledge-demanding domains.
   Findings - Activities associated with "bridging" and "bonding" clearly matter for creating value for the business network and the industry alike, as they are supportive of strategic capability development (for instance, high-skilled work). While producers and supply companies apply such "bridging," "bonding," and additional "protecting" mechanisms based upon their predominant position, small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), however, need to shape teams to do so. A major finding of the study is, thus, that team-based interrelationships among SMEs activate "bridging," "bonding." and "protecting" initiatives which are particularly supportive of capability improvement and industry growth. They enable the transfer of relevant capabilities between different projects where actors within SMEs organizations learn to activate and use such knowledge transfer mechanisms. Moreover, asymmetrical dependency-relationships can be partly overcome by shaping and using the mechanisms on the part of SMEs in the network.
   Originality/value - To date, brokerage is still an under-explored topic with regard to inter-firm business networks. This case study contributes to the research by illustrating important and distinct qualitative aspects of brokerage, which are conceptualized as "bonding," "bridging," and "protecting" initiatives on the part of brokers. The study highlights that not only strong actors with central positions can step into the role as a broker. Even less resourceful actors within asymmetrical relations can act as broker and compensate a lack of resources or strengthen their position within the industry network. Consequently, value co-creating processes within industry networks can also be boosted by brokerage initiated by small companies.

AB This study conducted an empirical estimation of the effects of R&D cooperation and the proportion of R&D personnel on the performance of four different kinds of innovation in the two major KIBS industries (t-KIBS andp-KIBS). For the empirical analysis, we used a multivariate probit model with 956 samples from the KIBS industry collected using the officially adopted Korean Innovation Survey of 2016. We found that vertical R&D cooperation had a positive effect on the overall performance in thet-KIBS industry, especially on service and marketing performances. On the other hand, horizontal R&D cooperation (competitor and institutional innovation) had a heterogeneous effect on the innovation of the KIBS industry depending on the type of cooperation. The proportion of R&D-dedicated personnel had a positive effect on service product innovation in thep-KIBS industry, but contrary to expectation, a high proportion of R&D personnel had no positive moderating effect with R&D cooperation in improving innovation performance. On the contrary, a high proportion of R&D personnel combined with institutional cooperation negatively affected the achievement of service innovation.

AB Voluntary adoption of pollution prevention (P2) practices has been used to reduce toxic emissions in the US. Spillovers among facilities owned by the same firm likely play an important role in the diffusion of P2 practices. This article estimates the intrafirm spillover effects of P2 adoption. Using instrumental variables methods applied to facility panel data from the Toxics Release Inventory, we find that a facility's own adoption of P2 practices increases in response to greater P2 adoption by facilities from the same firm. Intrafirm spillovers are stronger among small firms and firms with higher degree of sibling homophily.

AB Prior work on innovation has generally emphasized the importance of an organization's exposure to external knowledge. This study, in contrast, redirects our attention toward conditions under which such exposure serves as constraints on organizational endeavors to achieve environmentally preferable innovation. We develop a two-stagemodel for sustainable innovation. A firm in the first stage explores a variety of alternatives and develops strategic intentions to address broader environmental concerns; thus, it may benefit from access to both diverse sources of external knowledge and network ties that enable an extensive search for new information. In the second stage, a firm exploits limited available options to achieve its strategic intentions. We suggest that dependence on external knowledge in the first stage makes the transition toward the second stage challenging, thereby reducing the probability that a firm's strategic intentions for sustainability result in actual innovation outcomes. We test our theory using the 2014 Korean Innovation Survey. Our results show that diverse sources of external knowledge through rich network ties, albeit the positive main effects on innovation outcomes, negatively moderate the relationship between a firm's intentions for environmental sustainability and its achievement of sustainable innovation. Several theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB This paper studies the impact of the diversity of domestic and international innovation partnerships on the innovation outcomes of South African firms. A number of competing hypotheses are formulated and tested empirically using a sample of South African firms in manufacturing and services by applying Ordinary Least Squares regression analyses. Results show that having an innovation partnership, particularly an international partnership, is beneficial to innovation outcomes. However, it also emerges that too diverse a set of international partnerships is detrimental to innovation outcomes. The paper concludes with a discussion and a number of proposals for future research.

AB It is a major challenge for project-based organizations to learn across project boundaries by making project-level knowledge available to the organization as a whole. This study argues that project teams' social capital is conducive to overcoming barriers to learning in project-based organizations. Based on a large-scale analysis of engineering projects in Germany, the study shows that project teams' social capital, i.e. the intraorganizational social ties of project teams with their colleagues outside the project, compensates for project teams' lack of opportunity, motivation, and ability to make project-leamings available to the organization as a whole. By contributing to overcoming barriers to learning in project-based organizations, social capital represents an important driver of organizational learning about market conditions, products and technologies as well as project management.

AB We examine why commercialization of interdisciplinary research, especially from distant scientific domains, is different from commercialization of inventions from specialized or proximate domains. We argue that anticipated coordination costs arising from the need to transfer technology to licensee firms and from the need for an inventor team's members to work together to further develop a technology significantly impact commercialization outcomes. We use a sample of 3,776 university invention disclosures to test whether variation in the types of experience of the scientists on a team influences the likelihood that an invention will be licensed. We proffer evidence to support our hypotheses that anticipated coordination costs influence whether an invention is licensed and that specific forms of team experience attenuate such coordination costs. The implications of these findings for theories of coordination, innovation, and entrepreneurship are discussed.

AB The literature on how network-based incubation influences the performance of technology-based start-ups has recently grown considerably and provided valuable insights. However, at the same time this literature has become quite fragmented, inconsistently conceptualised, and theoretically underdeveloped. Therefore, this article uses three management theories to structure the literature, improve the theoretical underpinning and develop an agenda for further research. The management theories are the resource-based view, knowledge-based view, organisational learning, and social capital theory. We find that the network-based incubation literature has convincingly shown that network-based incubation provides start-ups with resources, capabilities, knowledge, learning and social capital. However, the influence of these intermediary benefits on start-up performance is ambiguous. There is a considerable opportunity to advance the network-based incubation literature with contemporary insights from management theories. We propose an agenda for further research on network-based incubation that leads to a fine-grained model of the mechanisms and impact of network-based incubation that goes beyond taken for granted assumptions about the positive impact of network-based incubation.

AB We determine the impact of the macro-design of a firm's alliance portfolio on its open-innovation effectiveness. Three elements of macro-design-international, technological, and partner diversity-are theorized to affect the breadth of knowledge sourcing, which is an important facet of open-innovation effectiveness. We test our hypotheses on a sample of 982 firm-years in the biotech industry. We find a U-shaped relationship between knowledge-sourcing breadth and international diversity. We also find that that technological diversity has no impact on knowledge-sourcing breadth. Furthermore, when seeking valuable knowledge, partner diversity is detrimental to knowledge-sourcing breadth. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Strategic alliance research emerged to explain alliance formation based upon transaction cost minimisation and opportunism reduction. Later research, and early research from Japan, emphasised the role of alliances in facilitating the transfer of knowledge between organisations. Most recently, alliance research has focussed on the development of shared, potentially idiosyncratic, resource stocks. This paper builds on this recent research, testing the proposition that alliances are important vehicles allowing firms to access or acquire external resources, hence shoring up capability gaps and building new capabilities as required during firm, product and industry life cycles. Using a sample from Australian manufacturing small-and-medium-sized enterprises, the paper reveals that alliances employed by firms can be viewed as initiatives to either fill a gap in the firm's resource stock or to exploit a perceived opportunity in its operational and strategic environment.

AB Alliance research has traditionally focused on structural and relational aspects of the networks in which firms are situated, paying less attention to the inherent characteristics of their partners. This study introduces the notion of alliance portfolio internationalization (API), which refers to the degree of foreignness of partners in a firm's collection of immediate alliance relationships. We develop a framework to explain how API impacts firm performance. We suggest that as a firm's API increases, financial performance is expected to initially decline, then improve, and finally decline again. This sigmoid relationship between API and financial performance is ascribed to evolving learning effects that shape the net benefits of API. When the firm's alliance portfolio, on average, consists of proximate foreign partners, the firm may fail to recognize latent national differences, but at moderate levels of API, its absorptive capacity and specialized collaborative routines support the exchange of valuable network resources. Nevertheless, high levels of API undermine firm performance because of the failure of collaborative routines and mounting liabilities of cross-national differences. We test the framework using data on the alliance portfolios of U. S.-based software firms from 1990 to 2001. The results provide support for the sigmoid relationship as well as for our predictions that firms, which have gained experience with foreign partners and maintained wholly owned subsidiaries in their partners' countries of origin, can overcome some of the liabilities of API and better leverage its benefits.

AB This paper investigates how relationship embeddedness in MNC subsidiaries' corporate and external networks influences the contribution of innovation transfer to the recipient subsidiary's business performance. OLS regressions using data on the intra-MNC transfer of 224 innovations indicate that the embeddedness of a subsidiary's relationships in the corporate and external network positively affects the received innovation's contribution to business performance. More detailed analysis demonstrates that the positive link between a subsidiary's embeddedness in the external network and the contribution to business performance of receiving an innovation is negatively affected when the innovation is unique compared with other innovations on the market.

AB This article examines the organising patterns of a multi-centred network, which has no single firm assuming overall leadership. It analyses how interdependent collective action plays an important role in the organising activities, and the article describes how these collective action groups are configured and how that structural configuration influences the complementary and reciprocal information transfers needed to create tacit knowledge. These activities are illustrated through reference to the metaphor of jazz, which demonstrates how these networks are organised through a process of improvisation. This gives insights into the seemingly unplanned activities that characterise the networked economy. The structural arrangement of networks, with nodes and interconnections, allows multiple opportunities for strategic capacity building via harmonic rhythms within the architectural configuration. With the network being in the groove' through a portfolio of interconnected ties, this structural optimisation leads to the development of value chain capabilities that contribute to the enrichment of strategic networked communities.

AB Purpose Universities, when collaborating with industry, are generally assumed to be the motors for innovation. Inspired by a case on a university's collaboration with small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in a regional strategic network (RSN), this paper aims to put forth how the university makes important contributions through transferring knowledge on innovation processes that is a teaching role, rather than sees itself as the party producing innovations. This paper describes and discusses the university's teaching role and its consequences in university-industry collaborations for innovation. Design/methodology/approach Empirically, the paper departs from a mid-Swedish RSN where nine SMEs started to work with a university. Interviews with representatives of the nine SMEs participating in the innovation project, along with university and RSN representatives, comprise the main data source. The paper analyzes the university's teaching role and the consequences of it. Findings Findings point at how the SMEs developed structured innovation processes, improved their market intelligence and increased their efficiency in providing new solutions. The university facilitated knowledge, while the SMEs responded through creating knowledge both on how to innovate and in terms of innovations. Originality/value The teaching role, which would mean that the university stays with one of its core functions, indicates a need to rethink university-industry collaboration related to expectations and role division. Moving from producing innovations to facilitating knowledge on how to innovate, would, for universities, mean that they minimize those conflicts emerging from their various roles and indicate that the production of innovation is placed at those devoted to run and grow businesses.

AB Innovating firms establish alliance portfolios in hopes of creating recombinant innovation, an outcome of combining new ideas from diverse technological domains. We draw on research in alliances, social networks, and knowledge spillovers to identify the configuration of alliance portfolio that links to recombinant innovation. Our longitudinal analysis of firms in the biotechnology industry shows that the technological diversity of a firm's alliance portfolio has a positive impact on the breadth of recombinant innovation produced by the firm. This relationship is strengthened in the presence of explorative alliance experience, rather than exploitative alliance experience, between the firm and its portfolio partners and among the portfolio partners. However, the positive influence of alliance experience in general diminishes when more than half of portfolio partners have prior ties with the firm. Finally, our licensing revenue data show that the breadth of recombinant innovation is strongly related to the economic value of the innovation. Our findings suggest that innovating firms need to manage the balancing act between sourcing for ideas from unfamiliar domains and leveraging alliance experience in configuring their alliances in aggregate. This study offers new insight into the composition and the collective experience of alliance portfolios, extending our understanding of alliance performance beyond the outcome of bilateral alliances.

AB The proliferation of breakthrough technologies and innovations among many industries has spurred the formulation of new types of competitive strategies and imperatives to learn new sources of competitive advantage. It is increasingly the case that the rising costs and risks of innovation make it increasingly difficult for any firm to undertake this knowledge-intensive endeavour completely on its own. As firms move towards establishing closer relationships with their suppliers, partners, and even their competitors, a new paradigm of strategy, value creation, and organisation design appears to be emerging. In this paper, we propose and define the concept of an 'innovation net,' whereby competition is based on creating new product architectures and technological platforms that often transcend the boundaries of any given industry. Within the innovation net, firms are becoming increasingly specialised in their value-creation activities, and yet simultaneously interdependent on other economic entities to shape the underlying value proposition offered to customers. Competitive advantage in the innovation net is based on learning and absorbing new sources of knowledge, no matter where they may emanate. A focus on modularity, cultivation of tacit knowledge, and learning alliances provides the key organisational design drivers that sustain competitive advantage.

Empirical evidence demonstrates that the RIS subsystems are not homogenous, and most have negative side-effects. Our results suggest that the 'quality' of economic agents cannot be successfully replaced by 'Keynesian policies' focused on enhancing Market Potential, Demand Sophistication and Governmental R & D Investment. Investing in developing Absorptive Capacity is the most balanced and short-term development strategy for regions averse to innovation and characterised by low industrialization and income levels.

AB Purpose. Internet companies have played an important supporting role in China's economic growth and social resource allocation in the advent of an exogenous shock: the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. This is owing to their digital, networked, and platform-based characteristics amidst an environment of intensified competition and stagnation of innovation activities due to the pandemic shock. Thus, based on the social network theory and resource-based theory, this study combines the DANP model with corporate innovation to build a product innovation performance evaluation framework for Chinese Internet companies. From a value network perspective, this study considers the different performance aspects of network embeddedness, knowledge management, environmental triggering, and organizational effectiveness. Methodology. The performance of Internet enterprise product innovation may be considered a complex multicriteria decision-making problem. This study used the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory-based analytic network algorithms to analyze the complex influencing relationship among the factors and calculate their weights. Preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation was used for selecting the final solution of multiobjective optimization. Three representative and influential Internet companies in China were selected for empirical analysis and practical evaluation, to find the gap between product innovation performance and expectations and present development suggestions. Findings. The study results reveal that relational embeddedness, knowledge sharing degree, cognitive embeddedness, structural embeddedness, knowledge absorptive capacity, and corporate strategic orientation are important to Chinese Internet enterprise product innovation performance. Practical Implications. This Internet enterprise product innovation performance evaluation framework can be used by Internet business operators to assess product innovation performance and identify areas of improvement. This study provides new product innovation ideas for Chinese Internet companies during an epidemic situation. Originality/Value. This study contributes to the present body of knowledge by using the DANP model to conduct empirical analysis, considering value network-related performance aspects to evaluate the product innovation performance of Internet enterprise in China.

AB Purpose Entrepreneurial activities are embedded within the networks of social relationships, which facilitate the flow of crucial information and resources. This study aims to examine the effect of social capital (i.e. structural, cognitive and relational), entrepreneurial competencies (i.e. commitment, conceptual and organizing) and micro-enterprise innovativeness (i.e. innovativeness and absorptive capacity) on the competitive advantages of the micro-enterprises owned and managed by women micro-entrepreneurs in Peninsular Malaysia.
   Design/methodology/approach This study used a cross-sectional design and collected quantitative data from 417 women micro-entrepreneurs from six selected states in Peninsular Malaysia through structured interview. For data analysis, this study adopted variance-based structural equation modeling, i.e. PLS-SEM.
   Findings The findings of this study revealed a significant positive effect of social capital on entrepreneurial competencies, innovativeness and competitive advantage. The findings also revealed a significant positive effect of entrepreneurial competencies on innovativeness and competitive advantage.
   Originality/value The government and other development agencies working toward enterprise development in Malaysia should therefore focus on designing a platform for women micro-entrepreneurs to promote the development of structural and relational social capital, which foster the flow of crucial information and resources necessary for suitable micro-enterprise performance.

We argue that, relative to industry FDI agglomeration, country-of-origin agglomeration provides an effective channel for the sharing of sensitive and tacit knowledge about local business environments. Therefore foreign investors in need of such local knowledge are more likely to locate in country-of-origin agglomerations. Empirical evidence based on FDI in Vietnam indicates that foreign investors who perceive local institutions as particularly weak, and those with a high degree of outsidership in the local environment, are more likely to seek country-of-origin agglomerations than industry FDI agglomerations.

AB In this study we develop a model to explain the dynamics of advice seeking after an acquisition. We build on a theory of advice seeking that draws from prospect theory and expectancy theory. We theorize that immediately after an acquisition there is uncertainty about who knows what, but over time individuals become more aware of the expertise within the organization and they change their advice networks based upon this increased awareness. Our model examines four micro-processes of advice seeking: reciprocity, preferential attachment, transitivity, and legacy-firm tie preferences. To test our hypotheses we use post-acquisition data over four time periods in a recruitment consulting firm. Our longitudinal analysis uses a stochastic actor-orientated model and our results indicate that immediately after the acquisition individuals have a tendency to seek advice based upon reciprocity and preferential attachment. However, over time these tendencies diminish. Surprisingly, transitivity does not play a significant role, which suggests that other micro-processes such as reciprocity are dominant. In addition, individuals in the acquired firm have a tendency to make more ties and there is a preference for same firm ties in both legacy firms, with the tendency being higher in the acquired firm. Our findings add to theories on the process of advice seeking under conditions of uncertainty, on knowledge transfer processes in mergers and acquisitions, and the knowledge based view of the firm.

   POSITION
AB University-industry collaborations (UICs) are one of the main sources of external knowledge and technologies for industrial firms, particularly in the context of emerging markets (EMs) and firm development. It is thus highly relevant to identify potential barriers internal to the firm as well as in the regional innovation system that might prevent firms from using UICs for innovation, in particular in an EM context. In order to address this issue, we conduct a firm-level study of the R&D-related segment of the manufacturing industry in Istanbul. Logistic regression analysis is used to test the effect of potential barriers on using UICs for innovative activities. With this approach, we are able to identify barriers that prevent innovation-related UICs and thus form a bottleneck to collaborations in the first place. Our findings show that lack of information about UIC opportunities as well as lack of financial support for UICs are the most relevant barriers that inhibit firms' usage of UICs for innovation. This firm-level evidence points out the importance of university technology transfer offices in regional innovation systems and for fruitful UICs. We further find that administrative barriers have no significant effect, while barriers related to trust and skill matching with scientific partners even have a reverse effect to what we would have expected from the literature. This finding might point towards an effect of perceived versus deterring barriers that has been observed in innovation studies before and might be relevant for studying UICs as well.

AB Despite general attention has been given to sustainable development and green innovation, little empirical effort has been made to explore the factors influencing green innovation performance in the context of supply chain relationships, especially in emerging countries like China. To address this research gap, from the perspectives of specific investments, we examine the role of specific investments in relation to the outcome of green supply chain innovation. Drawing on knowledge management theory, we propose that knowledge transfer plays a mediating role underlying the relationship. On the basis of the stakeholder involvement theory, we argue that partner social responsibility plays moderating roles not only in specific investments-green supply chain innovation performance link-but also in the link of knowledge transfer and performance. We tested the proposed relationships with a sample consisted of 331 questionnaires and validated responses from 187 high-tech firms in China. The results generally support the proposed hypotheses, and the integrative model-moderated mediation-is also supported. As such, this study contributes to understand about how specific investments affect the performance of green supply chain innovation, providing new insights on stakeholder involvement and knowledge transfer in green supply chain innovation management.

AB In settings where patents and intellectual property provide a strong regime of appropriability, the race to be the first firm to patent a product or a process is a central feature of competition. In this context, we hypothesize that cooperative arrangements that only gain access to external knowledge contribute less to heterogeneity between firms and have a much weaker influence on patenting than alliances that transfer highly firm-specific knowledge, residing in individual and social relationships. We also hypothesize that cooperations between private firms and public organizations accelerate the rate of patenting to a higher degree than cooperations among private firms. We develop and test these ideas on the population of 839 US biotechnology firms between 1973 and 2003. We discuss the importance of our findings on the debate about the value of knowledge access versus knowledge transfer in strategic alliances.

AB Whereas most of the literature on the benefits of alliances for learning and innovation has taken on a competence perspective, this paper provides an alternative integrated framework based on both a competence and governance point of view. The former focuses on the role of knowledge flows as means to access new knowledge, whereas the latter is centered around the core concepts of opportunism and freeridership in knowledge exchange situations. Although it has generally been acknowledged that competence-based benefits of collaboration may come at a price of elevated risks due to knowledge spillovers and freeridership, such a governance view remains understudied. This paper explains how a firm's alliance network structure affects benefits as well as risks of collaboration in the context of the creation of core and noncore technology. In the case of core technology, firms attach more value to reducing governance-based risks relative to obtaining competence-based benefits. The opposite is found when firms develop noncore technology. This paper contributes to the existing literature by going beyond the common idea that competence and governance perspectives are either complementary or competing. Instead, this study shows that for technology-based collaboration, they can both apply at the same time, implying a trade-off in some cases and offering synergy in other cases. Based on an empirical test in three different industries (pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and automotive), there is support for most of our hypotheses. Direct ties have an inverted U-shaped effect on both core and noncore technology, and the effect is relatively stronger for the former. The results furthermore show that indirect ties play a positive role in noncore technology development and that this effect is not hampered by the number of direct ties a firm has. In contrast, indirect ties seem to hamper core competence development when companies have a lot of direct ties. Finally, firms are found to benefit from nonredundancy in their alliance network in their efforts to strengthen their core technology. The joint effect of these three network characteristics leads to optimal results for core and noncore technologies under quite different alliance network structures. This poses a problem for the ambidexterity of companies, when they simultaneously try to strengthen core and noncore technologies.

AB This study examines firm internal network structures as a defense of intellectual property rights (IPR) in high-risk environments with inadequate IPR protection. Specifically, we investigate firm social and knowledge-based network structures individually. A foreign subsidiary can intensify social complexity by strengthening the small-worldness in its collaboration networks and attenuate knowledge-relatedness by decreasing the small-worldness in its knowledge networks. In a subsidiary, the effectiveness of these measures depends to some extent on the parent firm's experience in the host country. Longitudinal data on 401 foreign subsidiaries in the pharmaceutical industry from 1980 to 2017 have been analyzed in a quasi-experiment using difference-in-differences and two-stage regression. The results provide empirical support for these ideas. Findings highlight the explanatory power of internal network structures when discussing knowledge protection and show the utility of taking an internal network defense perspective in examining IPR protection.

AB Purpose - This paper aims to explore innovation in geographic business networks and to propose a model of cluster innovation capability. The premise is that innovation is a necessity for firms and inter-firm relationships is an option for it to occur. Among these relationships, clusters stand out, with studies showing that firms in clusters tend to be more innovative.
   Design/methodology/approach - Thus, we conducted an exploratory study of two clusters: the emerging cluster of Afro do Camaqua, in Brazil, and growing cluster of Sisteron, in France. The cases were analyzed based on elements previously established in the literature: context; collective strategy; public policy; commercialization; pro-activity; external relationships; transmission; collaboration; assimilation, transformation, and application of knowledge; governance; infrastructure; financial and human resources.
   Findings- We obtained a model of cluster innovation capability, composed of strategic management, relationships and learning, technological and marketing development, and operational management.
   Originality/value - The proposed model is a dynamic model as capabilities vary in their intensities according to the development stage of the cluster and its maturity time.

AB Using data from SMEs in Hubei province, the role of entrepreneurship in the sustainable performance of born global firms in China was discussed. The structural equation modeling analysis of 345 questionnaires indicates that both international knowledge and international entrepreneurial capability are significantly related to born global firms' performance. Dynamic capabilities, which includes three sub-dimensions: adaptation capability, absorption capability and innovation capability, was found to be less important to firm performance. Therefore, it may be argued that born global firms in inland China are still limited by resources, including those generated from the international knowledge needed to adapt to internal and external pressures.

AB Interfirm alliances provide a channel of communication between partnering firms. However, two notable communication barriers hinder the effectiveness of learning across firms. As the target knowledge is different from their existing knowledge base, the recipient firms' incumbent knowledge base may not be sufficient to identify target knowledge. In addition, inability to internalise and integrate acquired knowledge to the rest of organisation may handicap the effect of new knowledge. A growing number of recent studies have reported that the frequency of communication activities has positive contribution to the interaction quality between firms. However, we know relatively less about the role of transparency and receptivity in the relationships between communication activities and learning effectiveness. To address this issue, we designed a survey study based on the learning and knowledge transfer literature. The results of our analysis show that communication improves interfirm learning effectiveness, but such relationship is mediated by transparency and receptivity.

AB A large academic consensus exists on the idea that successful innovative processes are geographically bounded within regions. Nevertheless, the ability of regions to capture and re-use external knowledge is also regarded as a fundamental element to sustain and refine the local profile of specialisation and competitiveness. The present article combines these views to investigate the sources of the regional innovation process, by analysing data on Italian regions over the period 2007-2012. We define global networks based on all the local firms identifiable as global ultimate owners and their foreign subsidiaries. Our main results suggest that both the internal specialisation and the regional external linkages can generate indigenous innovation, but the role of the networks varies substantially according to its density, its degree of complementarity with the specialisation profile, its geographical spread and the specific location of the foreign subsidiaries. Our results, then, support a view of the regional innovation as an interactive process whereby valuable knowledge resources are not only generated within the reach of the local economy, but they are also integrated with external inputs. This contrasts with recent anti-globalisation views according to which the increase in the foreign operations of national companies impoverishes the local economy.

AB Where do businesses source the capabilities that influence their diversification? From the resource-based perspective, capabilities are located within the firm. For many economic geographers, capabilities are place-based and flow between firms in local areas. Others claim the capabilities that count emerge from non-local collaboration. The value added of this paper is a firm-establishment-patent dataset that helps identify the sources of capabilities regulating technological diversification in the establishments of multi-locational firms. Results show that capabilities located within establishments themselves are most important to the process of diversification, followed by firm capabilities and then place-based capabilities.

AB Purpose - Effective policy to support business ecosystems should build on evidence-based analyses of firmlevel activities and outcomes. This paper aims to contribute to this requirement and makes three contributions. The first contribution is to extend the application of the network capital concept to a variety of eight distinct linkage categories (e.g. suppliers, customers and business support agencies) that support networking and clustering, in both activity and impact terms. The second contribution is outlining a novel method of network visualisation (V-LINC) based on the collection of primary and qualitative data. The third contribution is in applying the method to one cluster, information and communications technologies.
   Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative research on the nature and extent of organisational network linkages was undertaken. Structured interviews with a set of focal firms followed a tailored design approach. The concept of network capital was extended and applied to the cluster context by measuring network inputs and output (i.e. investments and impact). The approach was operationalised via a novel impact measurement approach, denoted as V-LINC, an acronym for visualising linkages in networks and clusters.
   Findings - The authors develop a business impact framework exploiting novel linkage visualisations and qualitative data from firms in a cluster in one city region across eight linkage types to capture distinct network capital elements. Organisational inputs into network development, measured as investment and involvement indicators and organisational outcomes from those networks, measured as importance and intensity indicators, are used to assess network performance. A comprehensive, systematic and robust analysis of network elements and performance is possible. Distance is found to interact differently across linkage types. Targeted recommendations may be made from the analysis of local or regional business ecosystems in light of measured business impacts of linkages.
   Research limitations/implications - Due to the resource-intensive nature of data collection, the current study engages a limited sample of firms and interviewees. Applications of this approach in other contexts will permit further research into its usefulness in evaluating business impacts generated through networking activities.
   Originality/value - The method introduced here (V-LINC) offers a novel means to include both geography network theory into an understanding of knowledge relationships and networks within clusters. Accounting for both distance and linkage type reveals which categories of intra-regional and extra-regional linkages generate the greatest impact, given their frequency. The approach adds to available cluster visualisation and analysis approaches through identifying patterns of disaggregated knowledge flows and their impacts, with application to evaluation demands of policy.

AB Objective of study: this study aimed at analyzing questions such as how the parent company-subsidiary relationship as well as the parent company's actions can influence the development of innovation within the multinational company's subsidiary;
   Methodology: a multi-case study was developed, having as case units four Brazilian companies from different industrial sectors that were acquired in the past ten years by multinational companies, becoming subsidiaries;
   Originality/relevance: this study contributes to fill the gap found in literature related, on the one hand, to the challenges faced by multinational subsidiaries regarding their ability to innovate, and, on the other hand, to the need to understand more about the actions and mechanisms through which the parent company can develop, promote and expand innovations developed by the subsidiary;
   Main results: results showed that the acquisition processes that incorporated the Brazilian companies in the networks of the multinationals resulted in benefits for both sides, especially for the subsidiaries that, after the merger processes, had different types of innovation triggered.
   Theoretical/methodological contribution: the contribution of this study is related to both, the elaboration of a theoretical framework that united the literatures of international business, knowledge transfer and innovation management, as well as the development of a multi-case study that analyzed four distinct cases from different industry sectors to enable the analysis of the factors that influence innovation in the subsidiary.

AB Exploitative innovation and exploratory innovation have been a research focus in the field of innovation. This study proposes retrospective innovation based on this innovation classification by combining the spatial and temporal dimensions of knowledge in greater detail. Retrospective innovation focuses on discovering the new value of previous knowledge and reapplying it to innovation activities. Combining the embeddedness of organizational innovation in geographic networks, collaborative networks, and knowledge networks, the impacts of three attribute proximity (geographic proximity, technological proximity and social proximity) on the three types of innovation are explored. This study investigates these relationships using patent data from the nano-biopharmaceutical field. The findings suggest that geographic proximity positively influences exploitative innovation. Technological proximity promotes exploitative innovation but has a negative effect on retrospective and exploratory innovation. Social proximity has a positive effect on exploitative and exploratory innovation, but negatively affects retrospective innovation. In addition, the moderating effect of collaborators' innovation on the above relationships is also considered. Exploitative innovation of collaborators positively moderates the relationship between geographic proximity and exploitative innovation. A high level of retrospective innovation of collaborators enhances the negative effect of technological proximity on retrospective innovation of the focal organization, and weakens the negative effect of social proximity on retrospective innovation of the focal organization. A high level of exploratory innovation of collaborators enhances the negative effect of technological proximity on exploratory innovation in the focal organization.

AB In this article, we make two important contributions to the literature on clusters. First, we provide a broader theory of cluster connectivity that has hitherto focused on organization-based pipelines and MNE subsidiaries, by including linkages in the form of personal relationships. Second, we use the lens of social network theory to derive a number of testable propositions. We propose that global linkages with decentralized network structures have the highest potential for local spillovers. In the emerging economy context, our theory implies that clusters linked to the global economy by decentralized pipelines have potential for in-depth catch-up, focused in industry and technology scope. In contrast, clusters linked through decentralized personal relationships have potential for in-breadth catch-up over a range of related industries and technologies. We illustrate our theoretical propositions by contrasting two emerging economy case studies: Bollywood, the Indian filmed entertainment cluster in Mumbai and the Indian software cluster in Bangalore.

AB A discretionary social network in a firm is where individual employees voluntarily share new, innovative knowledge activities in this network are essential to firm innovation. Drawing on a unique field study we quantitatively compare the situation before and after a 'simple' management intervention aimed at increasing discretionary social network activity. We submit that both the network position as well as the formal role of an individual both needs to be taken into account to understand the antecedents to the voluntary exchange of valuable inputs within an organization. We find empirical evidence that someone's structural position in the network prior to intervention positively contributes to the value-of-input exchanged. Contrary to expectation, however, those employees whose task it is to professionally share valuable, new knowledge attributed the input for future innovation - ideators - fall short in leveraging a favorable position in a firm's discretionary, informal social network.

AB The debate on innovation systems has recently been improved through the development of more dynamic and forward-looking approaches. Scholars and researchers have started to reserve attention for System Dynamics, a widely used methodology for modelling complex socio-economic systems. Moreover, recent innovation models such as the Quintuple Helix framework call for an effort for better understanding and forecasting relationships among ecology, knowledge and innovation, deeply analysing synergies among economy, society, and democracy. This paper focuses on the relationships between the Quintuple Helix and System Dynamics modelling from a quantitative perspective. It discusses how the application of Network Analysis metrics advances the understanding of an innovation system mapped with a Quintuple Helix model. Using Global Innovation Index, a Casual Loop Diagram has been designed representing the process of knowledge generation and innovation dissemination within the Quintuple Helix model. Identification of structural features within Causal Loop Diagrams through Network Analysis is likely to provide new insights into the emergent properties of an innovation system seen as a complex system. Meanwhile, analysing central drivers has the potential to identify leverage points. Results obtained show the benefits of coupling Network Analysis with System Dynamics modelling and valuable evidence of relationships among helices.

AB Many previous studies have advanced in identifying different modes of interactions between public research organizations (PROs) and industry and in assessing their associated benefits. However, few studies have adopted a social network perspective to analyze the relation between the characteristics of social ties and actors and specific aspects of PROs-industry interactions. Based on case-study evidence of linkages formed by researchers from a medium-sized Argentinian university, we include the strength of tie as one of the driving factors in the selection of PROs-industry channels. Following Granovetter (Am J Sociol, 1360-1380, 1973) we assess the concept of strength of tie as a linear combination of friendship, trustworthiness, reciprocity of knowledge exchange, and frequency of interaction. Using econometric techniques we find that stronger ties motivate the selection of longer-term bi-directional modes of interactions which, in turn, create knowledge benefits for PROs. In contrast, weaker ties are good enough for service provision, which creates financial benefits for PROs. These findings bring to the fore the need to conceptualize PROs-industry collaborations holistically, including the relational, social and historical nature of these processes side by side with technical and legal processes.

AB Most studies on innovation capability analyze the firm level. Little efforts have been made to understand the interactions that take place in inter-organizational agglomerations and the capabilities that such arrangements retain. This study aims to develop a theoretical framework of cluster innovation capability. The academic production about innovation capability of clusters in the business field from 2005 to 2014 was analyzed and the databases consulted were: EBSCO, SCOPUS, and Web of Knowledge -311 items were cataloged, 144 were available in full text, and among those 18 papers were selected. The cluster innovation capability was structured based on a theoretical framework through qualitative content analysis. Thus, acquisition capability, diffusing capability, and knowledge management capability are the main capabilities that constitute the cluster innovation capability.

AB This study investigates the extent to which international learning intent and different dimensions of international network searching (i.e., breadth and depth) contribute to innovation performance of emerging market small and medium-sized enterprises (ESMEs). We contend that simple international network searching or motivation for learning does not guarantee the successful innovation of ESMEs. The present study posits that the international explorative capabilities of these ESMEs enable them to transform knowledge from external network resources into innovation performance. We collected data from 204 China-based ESMEs and analyzed these data using structural equation modeling. Findings demonstrate that international learning intent and breadth of international network positively affect ESMEs' own explorative capability and thus innovation performance. However, the depth of international network does not significantly influence international explorative capability. Using learning and network searching perspectives on ESMEs' internationalization, this study elucidates that ESMEs can improve their own innovation performance by improving access to and application of external knowledge learned through extensive international partner networks.

AB This study investigates how intraorganizational search behavior of R&D professionals is shaped by the organizational design for task collaboration between R&D units. More precisely, we examine how formally prescribed R&D unit task collaboration and the distinct roles of R&D units as recipients and sources in such collaboration affect how intensively unit members search for advice and knowledge. To this end, we integrate theoretical mechanisms from knowledge search and organizational design literatures into models explaining the emergence of work-related advice networks among employees in corporate R&D. Empirically, we capture the influence of unit-level task collaboration on individual-level search by applying exponential random graph modelling to multilevel network data collected on 193 employees belonging to 38 R&D units in a leading German high-tech firm. Results show that the extent to which R&D units function as recipients in unit task collaboration on the one hand and as sources on the other influences unit members? search intensity in opposite ways. Members of units functioning as recipients for many other units search less intensively, i.e., there is a substitution effect. Conversely, if R&D units are sources for many other units, their members search more intensively. The latter complementarity effect is weaker for R&D units that are specialized on a particular product component.

AB Research has examined the process of "entrepreneurial migration," whereby employees from successful industry incumbents move to new ventures. This phenomenon has been linked to direct benefits to entrepreneurial firms, offering valuable knowledge and routines obtained by employees during their tenure at incumbent firms. We propose a theoretical framework in which shared experience-a common background in beneficial knowledge management practices-creates a "cohort effect," facilitating direct ties and innovation benefits to new ventures receiving inventors from the same incumbent firms. Analyzing longitudinal data on inventor migration to 658 new biotech ventures tracked from 1990 to 2013, we find shared migration ties increase knowledge and market overlap between firms, enhancing their likelihood of direct engagement through alliances and employee hiring as well as the quality of knowledge they develop. Our core theoretical contribution is the identification of a migration cohort effect, in which inventors who share contemporaneous experiences at incumbent firms and migrate to new ventures create unique relationships between those ventures. Where prior research on spawning and migration has focused primarily on the direct benefit of human capital transfer from incumbents to new ventures, we explore the broader network implications of similarities and interactions between firms receiving this human capital.

AB Purpose
   This study aims to explore the influence of a region's network location characteristics and indirect connections on its innovation capability. The aim is to assist regions in different network locations to use innovation resources to improve their innovation capabilities more efficiently.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This paper represents the Chinese regional innovation network using the gravity model. A theoretical framework is developed to explore the relationships between a region's innovation capability and its network location. Hypotheses are tested using hierarchical regressions.
   Findings
   First, this paper finds that a region's network centrality can promote its innovation capability. Second, a structural hole can positively adjust the relationship between a region's centrality and innovation capability. Third, a region's indirect connections can inhibit its innovation capability while exhibiting a U-shaped relationship in moderating centrality and innovation capability.
   Originality/value
   This study uses a multi-index system to construct an innovation network covering 29 regions in China. This network represents the innovation cooperation and overall situation of innovation in China. The paper is one of the first attempts at investigating the relationship between regional network locations and innovation capability. It is also the first attempt at testing the influence of indirect connections on a region's innovation capability. The findings provide a new perspective on the factors influencing regional innovation capacity and a new way for regions to improve their innovation capability.

AB This paper contributes to the growing literature on innovation networks exploring two understudied topics: the role of gatekeepers in innovation networks and the distinctive character of their linkages especially relating to their ability to overcome cognitive, institutional and geographical distances among network participants in the context of a developing country economy. We address two questions: (1) Which organizations play the regional gatekeeper role in innovation networks? (2) How are gatekeeper linkages affected by different kinds of proximity (geographical, institutional, cognitive and social)? The empirical analysis employs co-patenting data from Brazilian organizations. Universities and public research organizations are shown to be more likely to perform the regional gatekeeper role. Gatekeepers are able to overcome geographic and institutional distance. They also balance cognitive distance with other organizations when geographical or institutional proximities are present. Given their critical role in innovation networks, universities and other public research organizations deserve special attention in policies designed to foster technological upgrading and regional development.

AB Building on the organizational capabilities literature and theories of the multinational enterprise, this paper develops and tests a framework that examines the relationship between intellectual capital configurations and organizational capabilities in human resource (HR) subunits. Looking at 187 subunits from 20 MNEs, findings show that intellectual capital dimensions vary in their usefulness for generating, sharing, and implementing HR management practices. In particular, while certain resources may help in the development of one capability, they may harm the development of another. Implications are that an organization's intellectual capital investments will differ, depending on the desired capability.

AB A key element of regional growth is its ability to transform knowledge into innovation. This research combines a group of indicators which define innovative regions with a rurality versus urbanization typology, in order to formulate guidelines to facilitate the emergence of higher levels of organizational innovation. Three main findings stem from this work. First, rurality does not appear prohibitive to the achievement of organizational innovation. Second, in regions with low levels of tertiary education, a combination of high levels of collaboration among small- and medium-sized enterprises, and public investment in research and development facilitates significant rates of organizational innovation. Third, in general, collaboration among firms promotes organizational innovation. The results of this research are in line with those from other studies in the sense that regions with internal and external networks show enhanced growth and innovation capacities.

AB Although the literature has provided ample evidence for the decisiveness of the franchisor-franchisee relationship in explaining organizational success or failure, performance effects of franchisee-franchisee relationships remain largely unexplored. Yet a growing body of research indicates that by building interfranchisee relationships, franchisees can form advice networks in the chain. Such networks offer privileged access to resources such as knowledge, information, and best practices that help individual franchisees to become more productive. In this context, we study linkages between a franchisee's centrality in franchisee relationships and various individual performance outcomes, using comprehensive data from franchisees in 3 different chains in the largest European franchise market, France. We find that conditional on the specific governance structure of each chain, the results document a strong impact of centrality in advice networks on franchisee performance. Accordingly, we offer theoretical contributions concerning knowledge-sharing processes in franchise chains, and managerial implications as regards more effective cooperation management in practice, from the perspective of both a franchisee and a franchisor.

AB Patterns of alliance ties and patent citations, between firms in the chemical-pharmaceutical sector over a 13-year period, were mapped to draw alliance and technology networks in the industry. We then investigated how technology learning takes place in the networks. Learning was particularly high when the allies have had direct interorganisational ties, and when both allies have accessed the common pool of external or third-party knowledge. The results emphasise the importance of developing trust around direct alliance ties. There appears to be a tension, however, concerning the extent to which firms should have similar or different technology profiles, in order to learn most effectively from each other. The results suggest that learning is most likely when partners are similar in their technology base at the network level, but still remain distinctive in their dyadic technology profiles.

AB One longstanding strand of research in the development studies literature has concerned itself with the development of innovation capabilities in developing-country firms. As most of this literature focuses on domestic firms, foreign-owned firms, such as subsidiaries of multinational companies (MNC), have received much less attention. In this paper, we address this knowledge gap by conducting an in-depth study exploring the learning and capability-building trajectory of a single MNC subsidiary operating in the market for solar power in South Africa. We employ a conceptual framework enabling us to explore capability building arising from the dual embeddedness of the subsidiary respectively in the corporate network of the parent company and the host economy in South Africa. We find that the subsidiary managed to achieve an advanced level of innovation capabilities in a short period. Initially, learning through interaction with the parent company and firm-internal learning in the subsidiary were found to have been essential in the early stage of the capability building process. Learning through collaboration with local research institutes became important only after a certain level of capabilities had already been acquired. Learning by hiring was important throughout, but it became gradually more important in parallel with the increasing specialisation of the local workforce in solar power projects. Our findings are particularly relevant for a new type of 'born global' MNCs that is becoming dominant in the global market for renewable energy. Finally, we point to the importance of regulatory conditions in shaping the degree of knowledge transfer and capability building of MNC subsidiaries.

AB Collaboration is a key to success. Nonetheless, collaboration dynamics are affected by partner compatibility, which, in turn, is strongly affected by team member diversity. Studies on team diversity have shown significant variation in the magnitude, significance, and causal direction of the correlations. We examine how international R&D teams collaborate, investigating the impact of team diversity on innovation. We focus on institutional diversity to analyze how, together with the duration of the collaboration, it affects innovation outcomes. We argue that institutional diversity hampers effective knowledge sharing and negatively affects innovation outcomes. However, this negative effect is mitigated by the duration of the R&D collaboration. The longer the diverse actors collaborate, the more likely they are to overcome the barriers of institutional diversity and find effective modes of collaboration for knowledge transfer and innovation. We test our hypotheses in the context of 3658 clinical trial projects conducted between 2001 and 2015.

AB Focusing on the virtue-ethics tradition, this article analyzes the practice of networking within the business context. First, it distinguishes three types of networking: utilitarian, emotional, and virtuous. Virtuous networking does not exclude utilitarian and emotional networking, but these latter forms should be practiced with reciprocity. It is argued that virtuous networking requires (1) acting with good faith, sharing honest goals, and participating in licit activities; (2) sharing information, knowledge, and resources with reciprocity and even with gratuity; (3) serving with justice in asymmetrical power relationships; and (4) exercising a positive ethical influence within the network. Specific forms of unethical behavior in the practice of networking include (1) bad faith or abuse of trust, (2) opportunism, (3) abuse and misuse of power, (4) network cronyism, (5) networking as disguised bribery, and (6) cooperating in the wrongdoing of other actors of the network. The article concludes with some remarks about the role of ethics in social networks.

AB This paper contributes to the developing literature on complementarities in organizational design. We test for the existence of complementarities in the use of external networking between stages of the innovation process in a sample of UK and German manufacturing plants. Our evidence suggests some differences between the UK and Germany in terms of the optimal combination of innovation activities in which to implement external networking. Broadly, there is more evidence of complementarities in the case of Germany, with the exception of the product engineering stage. By contrast, the UK exhibits generally strong evidence of substitutability in external networking in different stages, except between the identification of new products and product design and development stages. These findings suggest that previous studies indicating strong complementarity between internal and external knowledge sources have provided only part of the picture of the strategic dilemmas facing firms.

AB Prior research on ERP assimilation has primarily focused on influential factors at the organizational level. In this study, the authors attempt to extend their understanding of individual level ERP assimilation from the perspective of social network theory. They designed a multi-case study to explore the relations between ERP users' social networks and their levels of ERP assimilation based on the three dimensions of the social networks. The authors gathered data through interviews with 26 ERP users at different levels in five companies. Qualitative analysis was used to understand the effects of social networks and interactive learning. They found that users' social networks play a significant role in individual level ERP assimilation through interactive learning among users. They also found five key factors that facilitate users' assimilation of ERP knowledge: homophily (age, position and rank), tie content (instrumental and expressive ties), tie strength, external ties, and centrality.

AB We investigate how subsidiaries exploit the knowledge flows embedded in internal and external networks and support their development in terms of scope (breadth of functional operations) and competence (ability to perform specific activities). We argue that individual subsidiaries have different organizational learning processes, which would influence the way subsidiaries evolve and manage multiple sources of knowledge and adapt their knowledge structure and routines systematically for subsidiary-wide development. Our analysis of 81 foreign-owned subsidiaries in China shows that subsidiary competence is enhanced by the knowledge arising from MNC networks whereas subsidiary scope depends on the knowledge embedded in the host environments. Moreover, organizational learning affects the way knowledge adapted from internal embeddedness but not external embeddedness. These findings imply that foreign subsidiaries must effectively cope with increased flows of distant knowledge within MNC networks while maintaining their location-specific advantage. The different outcomes of subsidiary development add a nuanced understanding of the relationship between dual embeddedness and subsidiary development.

AB Context: A particular strength of agile systems development approaches is that they encourage a move away from 'introverted' development, involving the customer in all areas of development, leading to more innovative and hence more valuable information system. However, a move toward open innovation requires a focus that goes beyond a single customer representative, involving a broader range of stakeholders, both inside and outside the organisation in a continuous, systematic way.
   Objective: This paper provides an in-depth discussion of the applicability and implications of open innovation in an agile environment.
   Method: We draw on two illustrative cases from industry.
   Results: We highlight some distinct problems that arose when two project teams tried to combine agile and open innovation principles. For example, openness is often compromised by a perceived competitive element and lack of transparency between business units. In addition, minimal documentation often reduce effective knowledge transfer while the use of short iterations, stand-up meetings and presence of on-site customer reduce the amount of time for sharing ideas outside the team.
   Conclusion: A clear understanding of the inter- and intra-organisational applicability and implications of open innovation in agile systems development is required to address key challenges for research and practice. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Since the early 2000s, a number of changes in national policies in each country have had a direct effect on the dynamics of local technology-led economic development. Here the particular interest is in those that relate to interrelationships (dyads) between anchor organizations (public sector research laboratories) and major local firms. The paper's focus is on how changes in policy effect strong local relationships and how multiple anchor organizations drive cluster development.

AB Given the operating context of multinational corporations, creating value does not depend only on the centralised development of innovation. In fact, it often involves the dynamic and interactive capability of generating relevant and adherent innovating solutions at the global level, including headquarters, subsidiaries and technology partners. Thus, the relational capability of dynamically developing innovation interactions can emerge. Accordingly, our objective was to analyse how the relational capability of a subsidiary can be optimised through the internationalisation practices for innovation adopted by a multinational company. For this purpose, we conducted qualitative research using the case of Siemens in Brazil. The results indicate managerial aspects of relational capability and internationalisation of innovation, in addition to mechanisms and interfaces of local development in a subsidiary.

AB Drawing on organizational learning and the relational view of the firm, this study seeks to understand the factors that drive supplier innovativeness in the context of cross-border supply relationships. To address this research objective, a survey included 189 parts and components manufacturers (suppliers) in Turkey; hierarchical regression analysis is used to test the hypotheses. The findings demonstrate that interfirm knowledge sharing routines, relation-specific investments, and governance mechanisms may promote supplier innovativeness by expanding the supplier's knowledge resources and encouraging it to invest in innovative activities. In addition, this research emphasizes differentiating effects of the supplier's tier position for the impacts of buyer assistance and cooperative tie. As such, this study contributes to the purchasing and supply management literature by empirically showing how buyer-supplier relationships, particularly in cross-border supply networks, affect supplier innovativeness.

AB This paper examines the alliance learning process from the perspective of local suppliers in a Global Production Network (GPN). After reviewing critical literature in the field, we employed a qualitative case research method to explore alliance learning antecedents, process and outcomes. Six Taiwanese technological firms with different positions in a GPN were examined and we found that these well-performing firms integrate both inter- and intra-organizational learning, as well as a bi-directional learning process. A framework of cross-level knowledge flow is proposed with refined alliance learning antecedents and outcomes. We also extend the typology of GPN positioning level. Propositions are suggested with results discussed for future research. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose
   Scholarly interest in interorganizational learning (IOL) has spiked in the past decade because of its potential to absorb, transfer and create valuable knowledge for enhanced innovative performance and sustained competitive advantage. However, only a handful of review studies exists on the topic. The evolution of IOL has not been studied explicitly and there is a lack of understanding of the field trends. To fill this gap, this paper aims to comprehensively review the literature on IOL and map its evolution and trends using bibliometric techniques. In particular, the authors use visualization of science mapping freeware to systematize the findings and interpret the results.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The authors synthesize the findings using "evaluative bibliometric techniques" to identify the quality and quantity indicators of the IOL research and use "relational bibliometric techniques" to determine the structural indicators of the IOL field such as the intellectual foundations and emerging research themes of IOL research.
   Findings
   Through an analysis of 208 journal publications obtained from the Scopus database, the authors determine the leading authors, countries, highly cited papers and their contributions to the IOL literature. By identifying the key hotspots, intellectual foundations and emerging trends of IOL, the authors provide promising avenues in IOL research.
   Originality/value
   To the best of the knowledge, this study is the first to systematically review the IOL literature and provide future research directions.

It also develops propositions concerning the manner in which a firm's ability to directly link itself to disparate sources of knowledge (network range) impacts the relationship between EO and acquisitive learning, as well as how a firm's ability to maintain a series of strong ties within a network (network closure) impacts the relationship between EO and experimental learning. Finally, propositions are developed regarding how firms can most effectively utilize EO and network participation to maximize levels of organizational learning while conserving their limited resources.

AB Social capital is the goodwill available to individuals or groups from their network of relationships. It is widely believed that social capital is useful in facilitating and governing hazardous transactions. But how social capital, in the context of a financial holding company (FHC), actually facilitates cross-selling is unknown, especially in an emerging economy. This article maintains that effective cross-selling requires an FHC to first access and accumulate comprehensive and tacit customer-specific knowledge (the "where from" condition) and then share and leverage this knowledge to other applicable business opportunities (the "where to" condition). The role of social capital and embedded ties is found to be critical to this process. Finally, we argue that the major route for the effective cross-selling within an FHC is from the commercial banking division to the underwriting division. Hypotheses are tested on the transactional data collected from Taiwan, and empirical results provide broad support for our arguments.

AB Studies have typically focused on the relationship between technological distance between partners in alliances, and innovation performance, from a direct tie or dyadic perspective. This paper explores the ego network set up in order to disclose how the second order technological distance, which is the distance between the partner and the partner's partner, affects the innovation performance of the focal firm. To accomplish it, the network of alliances is built using biotechnological joint patents. The main result of this research is the finding of a positive quadratic relationship between the innovative performance of firms and second-order technological distance. This result has two implications. The first one is that the innovative performance of each firm embedded in a network cannot be optimized simultaneously. The second one, is that firm's decision makers should consider the second-order neighborhood of the focal firm to establish optimal alliance in terms of innovation and enhance firm's competitive advantage. Overall, this research set a new perspective to understand and improve the role of individual firms in collaborative networks, and help to complement the dominant view emphasizing the role of indirect ties in order to innovate.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between the degree of subsidiary's external and internal embeddedness and the contribution on subsidiary's business performance of a received innovation. In particular it focusses on dual embeddedness of the subsidiary that receives an innovation from the rest of the MNC's network.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using Amadeus databases were selected 93 CEE subsidiaries located in six countries. Data were collected through a standardized questionnaire and three hypothesis were tested through an OLS regression model.
   Findings - The results indicate that the two types of embeddedness positively affect the received innovation's contribution on business performance. Moreover, the inclusion of the interaction term shows how a simultaneously high level of embeddedness in both external and internal business networks lead to a multiplicative and positive effect on subsidiary's business performance. This means that external and internal embeddedness are not mutually exclusive suggesting, at the same time, the presence of interdependencies between the two networks that leads the "dual embedded" subsidiary to better received innovation performance.
   Research limitations/implications - The results are limited due to the sample characteristics and the conceptual focus of network theory. Regarding the first point, the results are derived from MNC coming from developed European countries that are geographically proximate. Regarding the second point, this approach neglects the limitations of networks.
   Practical implications - These results, therefore, propose to management the need to force the subsidiary toward a dual embeddedness in order to achieve better performance when an innovation has been received.
   Social implications - This study puts in evidence how Eastern European policy makers should increase the knowledge sharing and accumulation in the local clusters between all the stakeholders with the aim at increasing the "appeal" of this area.
   Originality/value - The specific contest in which the embedddedness component is analyzed is the main contribution of the paper because most of the previous research have been focussed on subsidiaries that develop and transfer the innovation. Moreover, the specific area where subsidiaries are located (Central and East Europe) may be another important contribution.

AB Rooted in the notion of inclusive capitalism, the Bottom-of-the-Pyramid (BoP) approach argues for the simultaneous pursuit of profit and social welfare by creating markets for the poor. This idea has been both celebrated and criticized in the literature. We do neither in this paper. Instead, by leveraging insights from Amartya Sen's work on capability development and the literature on social capital, we offer a more socially embedded and community-centric BoP approach. By redefining poverty not just as a lack of income, but also as a lack of capabilities in Sen's sense that can be developed through leveraging social capital, we offer a systemic framework for understanding the societal impact of business-driven ventures in the BoP and empowering BoP communities through these ventures. Specifically, we argue that any business initiative in the BoP ought to be evaluated on the basis of whether it advances capability transfer and retention by (a) enhancing the social capital between a particular community and other more resource rich networks, and (b) preserving the existing social capital in the community.

AB We use survey data for 4336 scientific teams, located in 16 countries, where all members were working within a single lab, to test three context factors that potentially affect the capability of internationally mobile individuals to enhance the innovation performance of their research units. We formulate hypotheses on context factors rooted in the knowledge recombination and learning-by hiring theories. The results show that three context factors are positively associated with international mobility and the performance of the research units: the degree to which knowledge in the relevant subfield of science is geographically concentrated, the creative intent of the activities performed and the decision power of the mobile individual.

AB In the current hyper-competitive economy, it is increasingly important to understand how firms can and should access and leverage external resources, such as customer knowledge or supply-chain partners' capabilities. In this paper, we report the results of bibliometric analyses on external resource management (ERM) research in nine representative journals, and elaborate the underlying patterns and dynamics in this relatively young research area. A total of 1290 articles ranging from year 2000 to 2015 were analyzed with text-mining and visualization methods. We found that the annual number of ERM publications is steadily increasing, and identified and described four distinct research clusters focusing on integration & operational effectiveness, innovation & value creation, inter-organizational relationships, and knowledge transfer & learning. The identification of research clusters and key works and authors in this multidisciplinary research field can assist future research in better positioning their studies and finding the key references across disciplinary silos.

AB Using the panel data of 263 prefecture-level cities in China, this article explores the development of green technology innovation under the influence of intra-city industrial collaborative agglomeration and inter-city network connectivity. Regression results prove that both of them can enhance green technology innovation. However, further heterogeneity tests suggest that the promoting power of industrial collaborative agglomeration is only significant in the eastern, central and medium-level cities. Meanwhile, there is a significant negative moderating correlation between industrial collaborative agglomeration and network connectivity. This negative moderating effect is particularly significant in the eastern, high and low-level cities.

AB Homogeneity in the industrial district with respect to outside companies has traditionally been an assumption in the literature. However, this paper suggests that districts show a certain degree of heterogeneity Thus, based on relational variables, two different networks can be referred to: Core and Periphery These groups of firms vary in terms of behavior and performance. Using quantitative methods, this research explores the existence of significant differences in technical efficiency and innovation between the two groups of firms in the Spanish ceramic the industrial district Findings confirming internal heterogeneity suggest new lines of research in this field.

AB This article argues that innovation in and from emerging economies is largely shaped by the challenges of sustained catching-up with the advanced economies. Just as firms and industries are constantly seeking to upgrade their technological and organizational capabilities, so too are their societies reconfiguring their institutions and networks to improve their knowledge resources. Such a co-evolutionary process requires IB scholars to draw on interdisciplinary work from the innovation and development literature in order to reconsider the key drivers of innovation at multiple levels within these economies. Innovation is not just limited to technological activities but includes organizational and transactional improvements, and is largely a process of recombination of local and imported knowledge, shared through multiple forms of collaboration. This can redefine the FSAs of local and foreign firms, often shaped by the strategies of domestic public and private actors. Simultaneously, policymakers need to develop the appropriate institutions needed to underpin R&D, training, standards, and knowledge coordination. MNEs play unique roles as instigators of innovation, as conduits for new knowledge, and as beneficiaries themselves, via their own recombination capabilities.

Based on the econometric analysis of a Chinese patent database, we found that inter-regional production linkages indeed can facilitate inter-regional collaborative research and development (R&D). The results further indicated that 1) the linkages of intermediate inputs and capital goods can promote inter-regional collaborative innovations; 2) inter-regional network capital positively mediates the relationship between the linkages of capital goods and the inter-regional collaborative innovations; and 3) the linkage among capital goods, network capital, and collaborative innovation is stronger when the regional pairs have higher Similarity of the economic development level.

AB Firms increasingly look to collaboration with alliance partners in their quest for breakthrough innovation. But how does the position of a firm in its alliance network weighted by the centrality of its partnersa concept which we term partner-weighted alliance centralityand the heterogeneities in the types of partners that it cooperates within terms of its private-public collaborationinfluence this quest? Using longitudinal data from the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, we build alliance networks in the period 1985-2001 to investigate these questions. We show that, for breakthrough innovation, collaborating with more partners that are more central in alliance networks the better, but only to a point. Beyond that point, we find that the likelihood of achieving breakthrough innovation drops. Furthermore, and looking at the kinds of knowledge provided by the partners in each firm's alliances, we report that firms with a greater share of private partners, relative to public partners, suffer less from the diminishing benefits of collaboration with central partners when developing breakthrough innovation. Taken together, we make novel contributions about how to organize for breakthrough innovation, and provide actionable managerial advice in terms of selecting collaborative partners in alliance networks.

AB This paper focuses on the simultaneous mediating and moderating effects of different governance mechanisms on the relationship between conditions for alliance formation and outcome. Alliance governance takes two distinct forms: contractual integration and procedural coordination. While contracts may help set the legal parameters of the alliance agreement, it is day-to-day coordination of activities and processes that determine the effectiveness of such contracts. The proposed framework explains how knowledge outcome of collaborative relationships may be determined by the match of partner motives, influenced by the mix of contractual and procedural governance. A series of testable propositions helps answer the following question. Do combinations of contractual and procedural governance mechanisms, given specific strategic fit, explain knowledge performance differentials? (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The software industry is unique in terms of its "platform economics" where many firms build their products based on dominant software platforms. Hiring workers from firms with high platform knowledge may thus create externalities for the recipient software firms. Yet, while prior studies have shown that hiring IT workers creates value for recipient firms, the sources of such hiring and the characteristics of recipients that increase value in the software industry are unclear. This paper contributes to the literature by uncovering that the value created through hiring IT workers in the software industry stems largely from firms that are high in platform human capital. Using a large dataset derived from an online professional network, we show that hiring platform-skilled workers from firms that are high in platform human capital is associated with a statistically and economically significant increase in financial performance of the recipient software firms. Further, the value of hiring derives from platform-skilled workers with tenure long enough at the source firms, and for recipient firms that are innovative and have high R&D intensity.

AB This study shows how R&D resources improve firm performance, taking advantage of open innovation activities in SMEs. It focuses on the mediating effect of R&D openness on the relationship between R&D resources and firm performance in SMEs. We employ secondary data of 1,046 SMEs located in South Korea's innovation clusters wherein scientific knowledge and technologies are efficiently created, transferred and utilised. The findings show that R&D resources (technological, human and financial resources) and R&D openness in SMEs positively affect firm performance. On the one hand, only SMEs with more financial resources (R&D investment) achieve better firm performance via a higher degree of external R&D collaboration. Fewer technological resources or more financial resources in SMEs can be a motivation for external collaboration. Differentiated open innovation strategies are required depending on the characteristics of R&D resources in SMEs in order to improve firm performance.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the effecting mechanism of relational embeddedness on technological innovation performance in the context of China.
   Design/methodology/approach - By probing into the related theories and five exploratory case studies of Chinese manufacturing firms, this paper establishes a conceptual model about the effects of relational embeddedness on technological innovation performance and proposes nine hypotheses. The authors then investigate 228 Chinese manufacturing firms by questionnaires, and testify the hypotheses and conceptual model by structural equation modeling.
   Findings - Chinese firm's relational embeddedness in the international manufacturing network has a positive effect on its technological innovation performance through explorative learning. Specifically, trust, information sharing and joint problem solving are beneficial to new knowledge acquisition and application, and then to the improvement of technological innovation performance.
   Research limitations/implications - This paper mainly focuses on bilateral relations among firms, regardless of the influence of network structure. Future research can extend to multilateral relations as well.
   Originality/value - The paper builds up linkages among theories of network resources, organizational learning and technological innovation to open the black-box of how relational embeddedness acts on technological innovation. It is a supplement to the existing research on inter-firm network theories in developing countries.

AB In the interfirm co-innovation process, knowledge search spanning organizational boundaries is believed to be essential to innovation but is often technologically, geographically, and socially bounded. Given that spanning any type of boundary may lead to both decreased learning and increased creativity, its influence on co-innovation success remains unclear. Using a sample of 18,575 US utility patents co-invented by 6,595 dyads of firms during 1993-2002, the net effect of interfirm technological distance (which depicts cognitive boundary-spanning search) on the quality of a co-invented patent is found to depend largely on other types of boundary-spanning searches, such as cross-regional and cross-network partnerships. The net effect is negative when co-inventing partners are within the same region and network, whereas the net effect becomes positive when partners originate from distinct regions and networks. The findings advance the understanding of boundary-spanning searches of various types and their complicated interactions, suggesting that boundary spanning is crucial to co-innovation success.

AB In the network strategy view, relative competitive advantage stems not merely from opportunity structures embedded it? networks but also from the distribution of ability and motivation among firms. Thus, there is a need to "bring the firm back in" to the network strategy narrative. We demonstrate that a mixed-methods design, blending large-sample data with micro-data on specific firms and their networks, can increase our understanding of the interplay of network structure and actor mechanisms, thus bridging the chasm between theory and practice in network strategy. We believe this is a critical step toward the "strategic design of networks."

AB This paper offers an integrative theory, through the use of transaction cost theory principles, that attempts to match the attributes of university-held innovations with the specific organizational form that best supports the identified attributes in innovation commercialization efforts. Two commonly utilized organizational forms are considered: the spin-off and the technology license agreement. Additionally, innovation transfer is conceptualized as a transaction and each of the organizational forms is considered an alternate governance mechanism for the management of the commercialization transaction. It is further conceptualized that by minimizing transaction costs, through the proper selection of the organizational form, universities may increase the odds of successful revenue generation from their entrepreneurial efforts. The overall goal of the paper is to enhance our understanding of proper organizational form-innovation attribute alignment as a key driver of innovation commercialization success, so that universities and their industry partners can increase their effectiveness in commercialization activities.

AB Recent theoretical arguments and empirical studies in economic geography have emphasized the importance of both geographical proximity and network tie for firm innovation. However, few studies have empirically assessed the effects of these two together. This paper examines and compares the effects of geographical proximity and network tie on innovation based on a unique dataset of equipment manufacturing firms in Shanghai, China. An extended spatial economic model is adopted for this analysis. We find evidence that network ties rather than geographical proximity promote firm innovation. This finding is different from previous studies using region as unit of analysis and suggests that geography and network may play different roles at different spatial scales. Moreover, we demonstrate that both internal factors such as firm's expenditures on R&D and human capital and external factors such as government expenditure on R&D and import of foreign technologies are important for innovation of Chinese equipment manufacturing firms.

AB In an era of globalization, new ventures have become especially active in collaborations with external partners worldwide to overcome the liability of newness and to obtain the resources required to innovate. In this context, this study conceptually analyzes how the geographical and institutional distances between a new venture and its international partners may influence the venture's ability to benefit from broad external linkages for innovation purposes. It proposes that the interplay of these factors affects not only knowledge transfer, but also business relations. The study advances theory on international collaborative linkages and innovation, by providing a novel framework that explains how contextual factors associated with distance affect the relation between new ventures' collaborations and their ability to develop innovations.

AB When they lack resources to commercialize science, entrepreneurs rely on intermediary organizations often within their local ecosystems. This paper seeks to improve our understanding of how intermediaries operate to advance the commercialization of science by providing a set of specialized services. We review five intermediaries commonly mentioned in the ecosystem literature: university technology transfer and licensing offices; physical space (incubators, accelerators, and co-working spaces); professional services providers; networking, connecting, and assisting organizations; and finance providers (including venture capital, angel investors, public financing, and crowdfunding). Specifically, we explore how these various intermediaries function and provide complementary and related services in support of scientific commercialization through entrepreneurship. After defining intermediation, we review the literature on each organization type, providing a definition and considering the contribution of the intermediary and the related policy implications. Each section concludes with suggestions for additional research.

AB Formal organizational relationships are important sources for capability building in emerging economy firms eager to move up the value chain. We examine how access to valuable knowledge available to firms via organizational relationships creates learning opportunities necessary for the development of complex technological capabilities. Using a sample of 852 observations of emerging economy firms from the Indian software industry between 1992 and 2000, we find that developing strong domestic intra-organizational relationships, through affiliation with a moderately diversified business group or operating in a related industry, promote more complex technological capabilities. In the case of foreign inter-organizational relationships, we find that greater foreign client contact enhances the complexity of firm technological capabilities. However, accessing knowledge from domestic inter-organizational relationships appears to hinder the development of firm complex technological capabilities. An interesting result from our research was that having greater access to knowledge from foreign intra-organizational relationships, embedded within foreign subsidiaries, did not lead to the development of complex firm technological capabilities. The results of our study highlight that for emerging economy firms wanting to improve their complex technological capabilities, there may be diminishing benefits to learning from and acquiring knowledge available within specific types of formal organizational relationships.

AB In this paper, we provide an ex-ante explanation for why some technologies such as James Watt's steam engine move successfully across broad technological fields, while other technologies do not. Using a sample of VC-backed biotechnology firms, we examine firm knowledge exploration choices along three dimensions the decision to build from technologies across broad fields, the decision to explore application domains that are new to the firm, and the decision to mix these two options at the same time. We argue that firm-level invention decisions find differing responses when received by the selection environment. We find evidence of a "breadth-of-impact frontier" for technologies, wherein the choice of whether a firm should enter into a new application domain than those of the past should be informed by the degree to which the technology is citing poor work narrowly or broadly. The findings suggest that the belief that broad sourcing diversity will always result in greater citation diversity requires some caveats. The results contribute to the understanding of not only how entrepreneurial firms evolve but also how individual firms contribute to collective progress. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper assesses the role of locally-recruited R&D personnel relative to their expatriate counterparts as regards innovation in multinational subsidiaries in an emerging economy. Two hypotheses are developed based on a network approach to multinational enterprises in an emerging economy setting, and tested on a sample of 317 multinational subsidiaries in China. Our results indicate that locally-recruited R&D personnel have played a limited role in innovation within multinational subsidiaries. While making a marginally significant contribution to R&D output due to their direct supply of technological knowledge, locally-recruited R&D personnel are unable to translate subsidiary R&D expenditure into successful patent applications probably because of their lack of technology management skills. In comparison, R&D expatriates significantly contribute to multinational subsidiary R&R output in both dimensions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study aims to investigate how innovation networks are organized with the concept of living lab, a open, user-centered innovation laboratory, focusing on the development of social innovations. It is based on a qualitative approach, characterized as a case study. The evidence is obtained through data from 11 semi-structured interviews with those responsible for two Brazilian living labs. The evidences were interpreted through the technique of content analysis and the technique of adaptation to the standard from the selected categories and subcategories and their indicators. This work advances in relation to others in its field by promoting the understanding that the specific processes and actions, called "orchestration of innovation networks" allow the orchestration of innovation networks built around the concept of living lab for the development of social innovation, but still associated to a new process that arises from the practice observed in this research, called co-creation management.

AB An important question for retailers is the extent to which control over suppliers should be maintained when there is uncertain consumer demand. This paper proposes that the level of network governance (high or low) affects retailers' level of unilateral control in uncertain consumer demands. The empirical results indicate that when there is a low level of network governance, retailers tend to increase the level of unilateral control over suppliers as consumer demand uncertainty increases. On the other hand, retailers who feel a high level of network governance may rely on unilateral governance to a lesser extent regardless of consumer demand uncertainty.

AB This paper views the Multinational Enterprise (MNE) as a differentiated learning network with foreign subunits playing a critical role in managing knowledge. Drawing on a sample of 92 subsidiaries operating in Greece, it empirically tests the relationship between sources of technology acquired and/or generated (internally or externally) and relates them to differently strategically motivated subsidiaries. Our findings record the existence of a multifaceted network of technology generation and transmission, which is differentiated among the different types of subsidiaries. In particular, results confirm the fact that larger and innovative subsidiaries have granted access to wider sources of technology. Moreover, evidence indicates that product mandates, as well as subsidiaries of a more efficiency-seeking nature, are likely to be better embedded in the local environment. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Market liberalization in emerging-market economies and the entry of multinational firms spur significant changes to the industry/institutional environment faced by domestic firms. Prior studies have described how such changes tend to be disruptive to the relatively backward domestic firms, and negatively affect their performance and survival prospects. In this paper, we study how domestic supplier firms may adapt and continue to perform, as market liberalization progresses, through catch-up strategies aimed at integrating with the industry's global value chain. Drawing on internalization theory and the literatures on upgrading and catch-up processes, learning and relational networks, we hypothesize that, for continued performance, domestic supplier firms need to adapt their strategies from catching up initially through technology licensing/collaborations and joint ventures with multinational enterprises (MNEs) to also developing strong customer relationships with downstream firms (especially MNEs). Further, we propose that successful catch-up through these two strategies lays the foundation for a strategy of knowledge creation during the integration of domestic industry with the global value chain. Our analysis of data from the auto components industry in India during the period 1992-2002, that is, the decade since liberalization began in 1991, offers support for our hypotheses.

AB Purpose This paper aims to advance the understanding regarding the profiting of collaborative innovation practices, focusing particularly on how the intensity of collaboration along the innovation process and the relatedness between the partners' technological bases affect the outcomes of such process in terms of efficiency and generation of technological innovations. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on the results from causal models and the estimation of average marginal effects, this research analyses the direct and joint effect of technological proximity and intensity of collaboration in the early and late phases of the process. Findings The findings suggest that there is a positive unconditional relationship between the aforementioned aspects and innovative performance and that the joint effects diverge depending on the stage of the process, i.e. while in the early phase collaborating intensely with close partners seems to be advisable, this circumstance proves to be problematic in the late phase of the innovation process. Originality/value The analysis developed provides clarity regarding relevant aspects of collaborative innovation practices, particularly, the search for and selection of optimal partners. In general terms, the evidence found here suggests seeking for collaborating intensely along the whole process with partners whose technological bases present a tight matchup with that of the focal firm. Results also call for awareness of the potential drawbacks derived from intense collaborations with close partners in the late phases of the process, thus hinting toward the convenience of developing protection mechanisms. In addition, this work provides interesting insights that challenge the notion of "proximity paradox" and set out further questions that might be worth considering for future research.

AB Background: A rare disease is a pattern of symptoms that afflicts less than five in 10,000 patients. However, as about 6,000 different rare disease patterns exist, they still have significant epidemiological relevance. We focus on rare diseases that affect multiple organs and thus demand that multidisciplinary healthcare professionals (HCPs) work together. In this context, standardized healthcare processes and concepts are mainly lacking, and a deficit of knowledge induces uncertainty and ambiguity. As such, individualized solutions for each patient are needed. This necessitates an intensive level of innovative individual behavior and thus, adequate idea generation. The final implementation of new healthcare concepts requires the integration of the expertise of all healthcare team members, including that of the patients. Therefore, knowledge sharing between HCPs and shared decision making between HCPs and patients are important. The objective of this study is to assess the contribution of shared communication and decision-making processes in patient-centered healthcare teams to the generation of innovative concepts and consequently to improvements in patient satisfaction.
   Methods: A theoretical framework covering interaction processes and explorative outcomes, and using patient satisfaction as a measure for operational performance, was developed based on healthcare management, innovation, and social science literature. This theoretical framework forms the basis for a three-phase, mixed-method study. Exploratory phase I will first involve collecting qualitative data to detect central interaction barriers within healthcare teams. The results are related back to theory, and testable hypotheses will be derived. Phase II then comprises the testing of hypotheses through a quantitative survey of patients and their HCPs in six different rare disease patterns. For each of the six diseases, the sample should comprise an average of 30 patients with six HCP per patient-centered healthcare team. Finally, in phase III, qualitative data will be generated via semi-structured telephone interviews with patients to gain a deeper understanding of the communication processes and initiatives that generate innovative solutions.
   Discussion: The findings of this proposed study will help to elucidate the necessity of individualized innovative solutions for patients with rare diseases. Therefore, this study will pinpoint the primary interaction and communication processes in multidisciplinary teams, as well as the required interplay between exploratory outcomes and operational performance. Hence, this study will provide healthcare institutions and HCPs with results and information essential for elaborating and implementing individual care solutions through the establishment of appropriate interaction and communication structures and processes within patient-centered healthcare teams.

AB A bourgeoning literature is stressing the crucial importance of agglomeration economies provided by large cities for personal, business and territorial development. One of the main reasons for the economic, demographic and social struggles of rural regions is exactly the lack of such agglomeration benefits. This paper explores the question of which broad strategies can make rural economies more competitive in the age of the 'urban triumph' by organising the presence of a higher level of agglomeration benefits in rural regions. Theoretically, three strategies are discerned: a) 'borrowing size' in infrastructural, transport and organisational networks to lap into' some of the benefits of surrounding or other metropolitan areas; b) urban concentration to develop a single, more attractive urban center in the rural region; and c) the formation of a strongly integrated network of complementary towns and cities in the rural region. The implementation of these strategies is often complicated, as we document for the rural province of Zeeland in the Netherlands. From an overarching perspective, it has been particularly internal fragmentation that has led to further marginalisation, peripheralisation and the missing of many opportunities to 'borrow size'. The strategies defined here show that rural regions are not unfortunate victims of the tendencies leading to the 'urban triumph', but have the potential to reap the benefits of agglomeration themselves.

AB A great deal of research on innovation implicitly relies upon the network in which a firm is embedded to explain its innovative capabilities. Interestingly, however, most research examines innovation at the firm level, rather than at the network level. Thus, there is a significant gap in the literature regarding the effects of network structure on innovation within a firm's network. In this research, we contribute to the literature of supply chain innovations by developing and testing theoretically derived hypotheses regarding the effect of network structure on innovation output and distribution, as measured by the aggregate count and variance in the distribution of patents of the ego network in which a firm exists. Utilizing a manufacturing joint venture network dataset, we identify effects of various ego network constructs such as betweenness, density, brokerage, and weakness on ego network innovation. We find support for the idea that innovation in a supply chain is highly dependent upon the network structure of the interfirm relationships. Thus, it is not just what you know or how well you individually innovate, but also how well the firm can leverage its supply network connections that engender superior innovation outcomes.

Exploring a firm's internal innovation activities, I hypothesized that structural centrality of an inventor in the intrafirm coinventing network is associated with her impact on her firm's innovation activities in an inverted-U-shape relation. I further hypothesized that this relationship is moderated by the firm's centrality and span of structural holes in the interfirm network. I found strong support for these hypotheses in a longitudinal study of eight large pharmaceutical firms. The findings in this paper, apart from having managerial implications, have implications for research on alliances, network studies, and innovation processes.

AB In a knowledge-based economy with increasing competition, firms are under pressure to enhance their innovation capability. Social capital theory advances the idea that social capital promotes firm-level innovation. However, little is known about the process by which social capital of a firm translates into innovation outcomes such as implementation of big data initiatives. Little research has been done on what role information technology plays, if any, in this translation process. In this paper, we investigate how relational capital, a form of social capital, in the presence of social media and IT platforms, impacts innovation in the form of assimilation of big data technologies. The direct and indirect effects of the three variables: social media, relational capital and IT platform is studied. Direct effects of the three variables on big data innovation is established. Social media and IT platforms are found to significantly add to the positive relationship between relational capital and big data innovation.

AB The aim of this paper is to provide a better understanding of the effect of social networks on innovation through the analysis of territorial systems of firms. Although industrial districts enjoy a number of advantages, they also present some relevant limitations. We have labelled the difficulties that have been identified as the exploring concern. However, periphery actors, such as supporting organisations, playing the role of intermediary agents allow districts to escape from exploring restrictions, since they can monitor what is happening outside the district and, in consequence, the involvement of supporting organisations has a positive effect on innovation. The study reported in this paper is based on a sample of 154 manufacturing firms that belong to industrial districts in the Valencia Region (Spain). Findings support the positive association between local institution involvement and innovation of companies.

AB This study explores (1) how two distinct dimensions of transnational human resources (HR) network learning, i.e. globally linked and locally leveraged learning, are related to the performance of the foreign subsidiaries of Korean business groups (chaebols) and (2) how strategic HR learning mediates the relationship between these two dimensions of transnational HR network learning and the performance of foreign subsidiaries. We propose that each dimension of transnational HR network learning is related independently and jointly to the performance of a chaebol's foreign subsidiaries. Our results suggest that locally leveraged HR learning has a stronger relationship with the performance of sales subsidiaries, whereas globally linked HR learning has a stronger relationship with the performance of manufacturing subsidiaries. In addition, we find that the interaction between the two dimensions of transnational HR network learning has a weaker positive relationship with the performance of foreign manufacturing subsidiaries than that of foreign sales subsidiaries.

AB Recombination of knowledge elements has been recognized as important innovation activities. This study aims to develop a new measurement of recombinative innovation and firstly explores its antecedents at the country-dyad level. We analyze 41,007 US alternative energy patents granted between 1976 and 2012. Based on multi-source data and longitudinal design, Quadratic Assignment Procedure (QAP) model results indicate that two countries' technological proximity (TP) takes an inverted U-shaped relationship with their recombinative innovation (RI), which means that TP could raise the potential of joint recombination, but should not become too high because of great knowledge homogenization. Furthermore, we test two types of distances (i.e., cultural and geographical) as moderators of the relationship between TP and RI. Cultural distance negatively moderates the relationship between TP and RI, but moderating role of geographical distance is not supported in this research. The findings of this study, besides having implications for management and policy, have implications on the research of recombinative innovation, inter-national collaboration and partner selection strategy.

AB This paper investigates the positioning of actors characterized by different natures in a regional innovation network and explores how these actors improve their innovation capabilities by assuming prominence or brokering positions. Innovation capability is widely seen to be the driving force in building regional competitive advantage, therefore investigating how the positioning of actors improves their innovation-related activities is relevant in terms of regional competitiveness. This paper builds on a survey conducted on the Sicilian regional area in Italy. A questionnaire was used to collect data concerning the relationships established between actors and the extent to which these relationships impact actors' innovation capability. Results suggest that regional actors cannot be considered as a homogeneous group regarding their positioning in a regional network and that the innovation benefits of assuming different network positions depend on their nature. This paper offers some theoretical implications to the literature on regional innovation network and practical suggestions to organizations and regional policy makers.

AB This study examines the role of service innovation, including service process, Information Technology infrastructure and customer acuity, on customer satisfaction from the network relationships perspective. This study tests the hypotheses in a sample of 136 companies, which is drawn from top 5,000 Taiwanese firms listed in the 2015 yearbook published by the China Credit Information Service Incorporation. The results indicate that service innovation is positively related to network relationships, and that network relationships have a positive effect on customer satisfaction. Also, the results provide evidence that network relationships play a mediating role between service innovation and customer satisfaction. The findings of this study contribute to the theoretical development of a conceptual model for explaining the interrelationships among service innovation, network relationships, and customer satisfaction. The empirical evidence of the Sobel test, in line with Baron and Kenny's procedure and bootstrap analysis supports the process-oriented view and indicates that network relationships mediate the effect of service innovation on customer satisfaction. Finally, this study discusses managerial implications and highlights future research directions.

Our empirical results, based on sample data from 242 Chinese firms, reveal that external network competence and intrafirm network have a positive effect on innovation performance. Furthermore, we find that an intrafirm network positively moderates the relationship between external network competence and innovation performance, and that relational governance has an inverted U-shaped moderation effect on the relationship between external network competence and innovation performance.

AB Purpose - This paper aims at integrating previous studies investigating the relationship between inter-organizational cooperation and organizational innovation. Earlier research provides mixed results regarding this relationship. In this paper, it is argued that this may be because of an empirical bias in these studies, as they tend to focus on one sector, one type of innovation or one country. Using a cross-national comparative data set enables to account for these potential biases and establish the relationship between inter-organizational cooperation and organizational innovation.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study examines the effect of inter-organizational cooperation on product, process, organizational and market innovation, using data from 32 European countries and 6 different sectors (n = 27,019). The data are analyzed using logistic regression analysis.
   Findings - The analysis shows that there is a positive relationship between inter-organizational cooperation and organizational innovation, even when controlled for common innovation variables including general characteristics, organizational structure, organizational culture, HR strategies, networking interaction and external knowledge acquisition.
   Originality/value - In contrast to most prior studies that rely on data from one sector, one country and one innovation type, this study examines the relationship between inter-organizational cooperation and organizational innovativeness by taking into account multiple sectors, countries and types of innovation. This intends to generate more robust results regarding the link between inter-organizational cooperation and organizational innovativeness.

AB This study focuses on the multiplexity of firm R&D networks, and it investigates two types of boundary-spanning networks: the bipartite network between firms and government-sponsored institutions (GSIs), and the traditional firm-firm network. We apply a social network perspective to examine the effects that these kinds of networks have on firm innovativeness, in relation to the effects of the firm's internal R&D efforts. We define the firm-GSI network as bipartite, and we investigate how the structural characteristics of this network (cohesion and centrality) affect innovativeness. We then decompose the innovational effects of firm-firm networks into two categories (intra- and inter-sector) to distinguish the effects of these collaboration networks. Furthermore, we investigate how these various external collaborative networks interact with a firm's internal R&D efforts for driving innovativeness. Our empirical study of 420 manufacturing firms in Mexico evaluates evidence from surveys and secondary data. The findings indicate that the structural properties of both firm-GSI and firm-firm networks have positive effects on innovativeness, but firm-GSI network cohesion has a stronger negative interaction with R&D in influencing firm innovativeness. Moreover, intra-sector centrality in a firm-firm network has a stronger negative interaction with R&D than inter-sector centrality does in driving firm innovativeness. We contribute to the literature by integrating insights from the perspectives of network multiplexity, social embeddedness, and resource complementarity in regard to inter-organizational behavior. Our study also provides meaningful guidelines for both managers and policy makers. The study's findings are robust to concerns of common method bias and alternative model specifications.

In comparison, the incorporation of social network ideas into international business (IB) research remains more limited. The purpose of this special issue is to foster further research on social networks in IB. In our introductory essay, we provide a brief overview of network research in the IB domain to give a sense of some of the major ongoing themes and to illustrate how the social network approach can provide fresh insights and add substantive value to the field. To emphasize the considerable potential of using social network theories and ideas to advance research and understanding in IB, we also indicate some future directions. We follow these with a summary of the five articles in the special issue.

AB Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We examine whether director interlocks enable or inhibit a firm's adoption of a proactive environmental strategy. Specifically, using resource dependence theory, we argue that director interlocks with suppliers are linked to varying likelihoods that a firm adopts a proactive environmental strategy, depending on the relation between the provided resources and the environmental approach. Research Findings/Insight: Based on a sample of US electric firms, our results show that director interlocks with firms providing knowledge-intensive business services are positively linked to the adoption of proactive environmental strategies. However, director interlocks with firms providing financial resources and fossil fuel are negatively related to the adoption of these strategies for our sample. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Board linkages may enable and inhibit proactive environmental strategies. We contribute to resource dependence theory by offering empirical evidence that the reduction of uncertainty about critical resources by director interlocks may either make business change easier or constrict a firm's autonomy, making change more difficult. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The influence of interlocking directors varies depending on the type of resources that director interlocks transfer to their organizations. As a result, the selection of specific director interlocks can become very important to the strategic goals of the firm. Regulators should continue to pay attention to potential risks for other stakeholders from director interlocks.

AB More than 25 years after its appearance, Ghoshal and Bartlett's seminal paper 'The Multinational Corporation as an Interorganizational Network' stands as a widely recognized but insufficiently understood contribution to the international management literature. This paper reviews related literature, celebrates and critically discusses Ghoshal and Bartlett's work and proposes ways to address its main limitations, which are a lack of a defined set of parameters describing networks and the delineation of network boundaries. We then translate their theory into concrete propositions and thereby bring it closer to empirical testing. Taking a subsidiary-network perspective, we expand the authors' work by combining network and entrepreneurship literature and theoretically deducting positive effects of networks on subsidiary entrepreneurial orientation. This yields entirely new insights and a more holistic view of the effects of subsidiary networks.

AB WINK R. Transregional institutional learning in Europe: prerequisites, actors and limitations, Regional Studies. Transregional institutional learning has become a buzzword in European policy-making during the last decade. A theoretical concept about how to initiate, observe, and support transregional institutional learning, however, is still missing. The following paper provides a theoretical framework to explain preconditions for transregional institutional learning and investigates the potentials of three different channels for learning: multinational firms, benchmarking studies and projects, and interactive policy networks. The results show that there is not much proof for enthusiastic expectations on future learning processes, but options for European Union policies to enhance transregional learning effects.

   THEORY
AB This paper presents the strategies that low- and medium-technology (LMT) firms adopt to generate technological innovation and investigates the impact of these approaches on the firms' innovation performances. These analyses are based on a sample from the Taiwanese Technological Innovation Survey totalling 753 LMT firms. The descriptive statistics show that about 95% of the firms acquired technology by technology licensing, while 32% of the firms engaged in R&D outsourcing. The firms in the sample acquiring external technological knowledge through collaboration with suppliers, clients, competitors, and research organizations are about 20%, 18%, 8%, and 23%, respectively. Using a moderated hierarchical regression analysis, this study reveals interesting results. First, inward technology licensing does not contribute significantly to innovation performance. Second, internal R&D investment negatively moderates the effect of R&D outsourcing on innovation performance. Third, internal R&D investment contingently impacts the different types of partners on innovation performance: by collaborating with different types of partners, firms with more internal R&D investment gain higher innovation returns than firms with fewer internal R&D activities. The results of this study contribute to a sharper understanding of technological innovation strategies and their effects on technological innovation performance in LMT sectors. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study presents a theoretical and empirical analysis of how CEOs' external social networks impact on cognitive factors (strategic schemas and self-efficacy in opportunity recognition SOR) to affect strategic flexibility and organisational performance. The research question was addressed using LISREL analysis, and the model was tested using data obtained from 203 Spanish organisations. We show that large but not strong networks impact positively on strategic flexibility. However, both types of network significantly influence CEO cognition (strategic schemas and SOR), which in turn encourages strategic flexibility. Moreover, the influence of strategic schemas on SOR is quite high. These considerations of how external social networks impact on strategic flexibility through the mediator role of CEO cognition extend previous research in this field. We derive inductively a model of entrepreneurial decision-making, explaining how external social networks may make a positive impact on strategic flexibility and performance, depending on their composition and CEO-specific social and cognitive factors. Our evidence reveals the combined nature of decision-making modes to respond flexibly to their evolving environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There is scarce empirical evidence on the impact of inter-organizational collaboration across research institutes, industries or/and universities on the scientific performance of research institutes. This paper fills this gap by examining how the research institutes' bilateral/trilateral collaborations with industries or/and universities influence their research outputs from a network perspective. We construct a unique dataset based on the Chinese Academy of Sciences' inter-organizational research collaboration networks with industries or/and universities, which enables us to build three homogeneous, heterogeneous and hybrid inter-organizational research networks as our multi-scenario sample. Our study confirms that the scientific performance of research institutes is significantly affected by their network positions in the research collaboration networks with industries or/and universities. Specifically, in the homogeneous "University-Research Institute" (UR) collaboration network, the degree centrality and the structural holes of the research institutes affect their scientific performance respectively in an inverted U-shaped manner and a positive linear one. By contrast, in both the heterogeneous "Industry-Research Institute" (IR) and the hybrid "Industry-University-Research Institute" (IUR) collaboration networks, the degree centrality and the structural holes of research institutes affect their scientific performance respectively in a positive linear manner and an inverted U-shaped one. Our findings indicate that the impact pattern of the network positions of innovative organizations on their performance likely varies with the network structure and composition in different inter-organizational contexts.

AB The formation, evolution, and dynamics of Industry-University-Research Institute (IUR) scientific collaborations in China have not been uncovered fully in extant literature. This study seeks to fill this research gap based on a novel sample of the China Academy of Sciences (CAS) from an ego-network perspective and especially reveals the guiding role of government policies. By taking the inter-organizational scientific collaboration systems of the CAS with enterprises and universities as a proxy for IUR collaborations in China, we explore the dynamic evolution and characteristics of the IUR collaboration networks in China during the period from 1978 to 2015. Our study reveals a simultaneous trend in accordance with the effects of the government's science and technology (S&T) policies on shaping the linkages among public research institutes, enterprises and universities during the last several decades. In particular, we find that S&T policies issued by the government may affect the dynamic evolution of the small-world structure in the scientific collaboration networks of public research institutes with enterprises and universities over time. This study enriches the empirical research on IUR collaborations in the context of China by examining the patterns of bilateral or trilateral collaborations between and among CAS with industries and universities around this country, which not only contributes to understanding the dynamic evolution of China's IUR collaborations in the context of a series of government S&T policies but also helps deepen our understanding of the characteristics of China's national innovation system.

AB A firm's competitive advantage can come not only from internal resources but also from inter-firm innovation networks. This paper shows that network capabilities (i.e., network visioning capability, network constructing capability, network operating capability and network centring capability) are special skills that enable values residing in network resources. Based on a sample of 211 Chinese hi-tech firms and by applying structural equation modelling, network capabilities are found to have a positive relationship with innovation performance. Four antecedents of network capabilities-IT maturity, openness of culture, the management system involved and experience with network activities-are also identified in the research and empirically tested. The results of this study provide a new framework that describes how networked firms can gain a competitive advantage.

AB Research on alliances has recognized the bright and dark sides of technological diversity between alliance partners. We extend this line of research by offering a model that examines how network centrality and learning speed shape the relationship between technological diversity and market performance. We tested the model by using a large sample of 769 firm-year observations from U.S. biotech, pharmaceutical, and medical device industries, spanning the period from 1990 to 2006. The results reveal that the degree of technological diversity between alliance partners exhibits an inverted U-shaped relationship with firm performance. In addition, this relationship is positively moderated by network centrality and learning speed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Prior empirical research is inconclusive in determining whether technology complexity influences the financial performance of research commercialization projects and how various types of organizational resources contribute to performance. We analyse research commercialization projects involving the collaboration between public research institutes and private firms in Singapore. We examine how the technology complexity of these collaborative projects impacts their financial performance, measured by the licensing fees generated. In addition, we determine how human, financial, network and senior management resources moderate the relationship between technology complexity and financial performance of the projects. Our results indicate that the relationship is inverted U-shaped and moderated by project resources. We find that PRI-firm projects with higher human, network and senior management resources are better positioned to cope with complex technologies. However, investing abundant resources in low complexity technologies reduces the financial performance of projects. Surprisingly, financial resources do not have any significant moderating effect. Our findings are relevant to scholars investigating research commercialization and academic entrepreneurship.

AB This study adopts the resource-based view to examine how two integrative capabilities of a plant embedded in a manufacturing network enhance operational performance: the capability to connect with other plants in its manufacturing network (a networking capability, NC), and the capability to integrate manufacturing processes with new product development processes (a new product development capability, NPDC). Our model tests the indirect effect of NC on cost, quality, flexibility and delivery through NPDC. Furthermore, we test if the relationship between NC and NPDC depends on the strategic role of the plant. Using survey data from a sample of 521 plants, we confirmed the mediating effect of NPDC. However, the moderation effect was not confirmed. Our findings reveal that plants can deploy NPDC capabilities, fostered by NC, independently from their role in the network. This study contributes to the understanding of plant capabilities and plant roles in manufacturing networks.

AB Recent work on SMEs and networks has emphasised the importance of external co-operative ties in enhancing firms' innovative performance. These external ties provide resource constrained SMEs with access to a wider set of technological opportunities through information sharing and resource pooling. Previous studies of the SME innovation-cooperation relationship have used categorical measures to capture tie existence which, while providing some useful insights, largely fail to capture the strength of co-operative relationships and/or the variety of relational directions in which co-operation occurs. This study aims to address this measurement deficiency and explore the SME innovation-cooperation relationship by designing and utilising measures that capture both the multi-scalar (strength) and multi-dimensional (variety) nature of co-operation and innovation. We then apply these measures to a survey of UK manufacturing SMEs. Data is obtained for 371 SMEs, and we then assess the innovation-co-operation relationship within a multivariate regression framework. We find that the strength of cooperative ties across a range of productive activities within the value chain are important facilitators for SME innovative capability; this is true for both product and process innovation. However, we find that SME co-operation with rivals (co-opetition) has no significant impact upon innovation. Our results have significant implications for both supply chain managers and policy-makers interested in enhancing innovation among SMEs. In particular, we argue that SME innovative activity benefits from good, close dyadic relations within the supply chain, while more generally policy should be geared towards nurturing and sustaining SME innovation networks.

AB Recent research into the clustering effect on firms has moved away from a simplistic view to a more complex approach. More realistic and complex causal relationships are now considered when analysing these territorial networks. Specifically, this paper attempts to analyse how cluster connectedness moderates the relationship of a firm's innovation effort and the results obtained from this effort. We want to question the commonly accepted direct and positive impact of R&D effort, and moreover, we suggest the existence of a saturation effect and that the level of cluster's inter-connectedness in the cluster moderates this effect. We have developed our empirical study focusing on the Spanish textile industrial cluster. This is a complex manufacturing industry that uses relatively low-technology manufacturing and R&D. Our findings suggest that the degree to which a firm is involved with, or connected to, other firms in the cluster can moderate the effect of the R&D effort on its innovation results. More generally, we aim to contribute to the discussion on the degree to which firms should be involved in the cluster network in order to operate efficiently and gain the maximum competitive advantages. Our findings have implications both in recent cluster and network literature as well for institutional policy.

AB Echebarria C. and Barrutia J. M. Limits of social capital as a driver of innovation: an empirical analysis in the context of European regions, Regional Studies. The available empirical research referring to different units of analysis supports, in general terms, a linear positive relationship among some components of social capital and innovation. Yet some studies also present controversial results by finding non-significant, negative, diminishing returns and quadratic relationships. Building on the social network theory of innovation, this paper shows that the social capital-innovation relationship has an inverted U'-shape. This is consistent with recent research that suggests that some sub-constructs of social capital, such as tie strength, involve maintenance and opportunity costs and that social capital has positive effects, but it also has its limits.

Critical voices argue that the same mechanisms that form the basis of efficient, continuous improvements of clustered firms can also be considered as limitations. We suggest that the impact of social capital decreases beyond a certain point of development In fact, the effect of social interactions and trust on firm value creation can be described as an inverted U-shaped curve.

However, HEIs' role as builders of the regional innovation system (RIS) has generally been under-researched. We review literature on the role of HEIs in fuelling the RIS and offer suggestions for deliberate actions that stimulate regional development. For further research we suggest to perform a network analysis addressing factors that relate to characteristics of: (1) HEIs; (2) regional firms; (3) the collaborative relationship; and (4) the environmental context in which HEIs and firms are embedded.

We examine how social network ties (business and institutional) influence indigenous innovation and the moderating effects of learning intent. Results from 270 Chinese firms indicate an inverted U-shaped relationship between business network ties and each pattern of indigenous innovation. In contrast, institutional network ties affect original innovation in the shape of an inverted U, while they facilitate integrative innovation and re-innovation in a linear manner. Learning intent shows significant moderating effects on these main relationships.

AB The emergence of big data brings both opportunities and challenges to high-tech enterprises. How to keep competitive advantages and improve innovation performance is important for enterprises in big data environment. Except from organizational learning ability and the use of advanced technology, the corporate governance also plays an important role in the process of enterprise's innovation practice. This article creatively combines with the insights of internal and external governance, and explores how the managerial power and network centrality affects enterprise's innovation performance in big data environment. Considering about the differences among distinct regional big data environment (strong/weak), this paper also takes classification research on it. The research findings show that managerial power has a significant positive impact on innovation performance, managerial power could enhance enterprise's centrality in network, and the enterprise which located in network central position has more advantages in obtaining resources and significantly improves firm's innovation performance. Network centrality plays a mediating role on managerial power and innovation performance. Further research finds that the positive effects of managerial power and network centrality are more significantly in the strong big data environment. These findings enrich the research of high-tech enterprise innovation from a combinative governance view, and contribute to the literatures on enterprise innovation in big data environment.

AB Background: In the past decade, there has been an increasing national policy push for educators to systematically collect, interpret, and use data for instructional decision making. The assumption by the federal government is that having data systems will be enough to prompt the use of data for a wide range of decision making. These policies rely on inducements to inspire local level changes; however, they leave the processes related to data use largely undefined.
   Objective: In this article, I argue that many of the studies on data use either invoke or directly assess network-related concepts and, as such, network theory and analysis provides a useful analytic and complementary framework and methods for examining the social infrastructure in the use of data for educational improvement.
   Research Design: This article reports on a literature review of the data use and social network literatures and the utility of intersecting both literatures for studies on data use for educational improvement.
   Conclusions: Many data use studies report that the interpretation and use of data takes place both within and between individuals who, through social interaction, are both co-constructing and making sense of data and their use. Given the increasing role of social relationships in data use studies better theorizing and understanding the dynamics of social influence and processes on the interpretation and use of data is needed. Social network theory and analysis offers a useful conceptual framework and accompanying methods for describing and analyzing the structure of a social system in an effort to understand how social relationships support and constrain the interpretation and use of data in educational improvement.

AB This paper constructs a mobility network of Chinese scientists and a cooperation network of scientific research based on data on mobility and research cooperation in China at the urban scale. Through several methods, including spatial analysis, network analysis, and regression analysis, the nodes and bilateral relations in the two networks are found to be highly coupled. Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Pearl River Delta are hot spots for the mobility and scientific research cooperation networks of Chinese scientists. Only a few cities in the two networks play important roles, and most of the cities serve as a foil. The spatial mobility and scientific research cooperation activities of Chinese scientists are concentrated in the eastern region, the Chinese scientists' mobility and scientific research cooperation networks are rhombus structure, the two networks both are compact and hierarchical network with Beijing as the single dominant city, and the power-law distribution in the bilateral relationship of two networks shows a "pyramid structure". Finally, we discuss the possible reasons for the spatial co-location relationship between the mobility and scientific cooperation of scientists.

AB The prevalence of personal connections in China, or guanxi, constitutes an institution that governs how people exchange favors. This study explores the effects of the guanxi institution on interfirm relational ties, information sharing, and the acquisition of skills across firms. According to social network theory, the marginal benefit of interfirm relational ties on information sharing should decrease with the strength of ties; according to information overload theory, information sharing should have an inverted U-shaped effect on the acquisition of skills. Institutional theory further suggests that the links across these three constructs are subject to the influence of the guanxi institution. With data collected from 338 manufacturing companies, this study shows that the links differ across environments that have strong versus weak guanxi institutions. A strong guanxi institution generally promotes information sharing and skill acquisition, but it also has a dark side.

AB How does returnee managers' international leadership experience influence emerging economy firms' internationalization? The internationalization process model suggests that international experience plays a central role enabling firms' internationalization moves. We propose that emerging economy firms can accelerate their development of international experience-and hence their international commitments-by grafting returnees with international leadership experience. We hypothesize that such international leadership experience has a positive effect on firm internationalization, and that this effect is strengthened by central-state ownership and private ownership, but weakened by local-state ownership and foreign ownership. Using 8-year (2001-2008) event-historical data from 164 Chinese electronic manufacturing firms, we found empirical support to our theoretical arguments. Specifically, returnee managers' international leadership experience is positively associated with emerging economy firms' likelihood of conducting foreign direct investment, while for other forms of international experience no positive effect can be detected. Our analysis of moderation by firms' ownership type finds that this positive association is strengthened by central-state and private ownerships, but weakened by local-state and foreign ownership.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore two distinct subsets of dynamic capabilities that need to be deployed when pursuing innovation through inter-organizational activities, respectively, in the contexts of broad networks and specific alliances. The authors draw distinctions and explore potential interdependencies between these two dynamic capability reservoirs, by integrating concepts from the theoretical perspectives they are derived from, but which have until now largely ignored each other - the social network perspective and the dynamic capabilities view. Design/methodology/approach The authors investigate nanotechnology-driven R&D activities in the 1995-2005 period for 76 publicly traded firms in the electronics and electrical equipment industry and in the chemicals and pharmaceuticals industry, that applied for 580 nanotechnology-related patents and engaged in 2,459 alliances during the observation period. The authors used zero-truncated Poisson regression as the estimation method. Findings The findings support conceptualizing dynamic capabilities as four distinct subsets, deployed for sensing or seizing purposes, and across the two different inter-organizational contexts. The findings also suggest potential synergies between these subsets of dynamic capabilities, with two subsets being more macro-oriented (i.e. sensing and seizing opportunities within networks) and the two other ones more micro-oriented (i.e. sensing and seizing opportunities within specific alliances). Practical implications - The authors show that firms differ in their subsets of dynamic capabilities for pursuing different types of inter-organizational, boundary-spanning relationships (such as alliances vs broader network relationships), which ultimately affects their innovation performance. Originality/value The authors contribute to the growing body of work on dynamic capabilities and firm-specific advantages by unbundling the dynamic capability subsets, and investigating their complex interdependencies for managing different types of inter-organizational linkages. The main new insight is that the "linear model" of generating more innovations through higher inter-firm collaboration in an emerging field paints an erroneous picture of how high innovation performance is actually achieved.

AB This study adopts a business network view to study the effects of subsidiary embeddedness on both subsidiary influence within the MNC and innovation-related business performance. Through Structural Equation Modeling we analyze subsidiary relationships connected to 85 innovation projects. The results show that external and corporate embeddedness are complementary contexts, although they affect subsidiary influence and performance differently. Whereas external embeddedness directly affects innovation-related business performance, corporate embeddedness strengthens the subsidiary's influence within the MNC, which in turn positively relates to performance. Moreover, as the study also finds that external and corporate embeddedness are positively associated, it stresses the issue of simultaneously balancing both external and corporate relationships (i.e., dual embeddedness) to nurture innovation projects.

AB This paper probes the extent to which the rise of the 'modern' multinational corporation (MNC) has come with significantly altered patterns in the emergence and diffusion of technological capabilities across units of the MNC network. It draws upon a database containing the complete U.S. patenting history of 24 Swedish multinationals over the 1946-2008 period, which allows us to trace both the emergence and subsequent intra-firm diffusion of technological capabilities throughout the post-war period. The findings show that, over time, foreign subsidiaries have become an increasingly important source of new technological capabilities within the MNC network, and also indicate that the overall pace of capability diffusion has become faster over the observed time period. Notably, however, the results reveal substantial heterogeneity of individual firms' approaches to organizing and managing technological capabilities within the MNC network.

AB One of the biggest challenges facing leaders today is the need to position and enable organizations and people for adaptability in the face of increasingly dynamic and demanding environments. Despite this we know surprisingly little about this topic. In this paper we provide a theoretical synthesis and integrative review of research from strategy, organization theory, innovation, networks, and complexity to provide a framework of leadership for organizational adaptability. Our review shows that leadership for organizational adaptability is different from traditional leadership or leading change. It involves enabling the adaptive process by creating space for ideas advanced by entrepreneurial leaders to engage in tension with the operational system and generate innovations that scale into the system to meet the adaptive needs of the organization and its environment. Leadership for organizational adaptability calls for scholars and practitioners to recognize organizational adaptability as an important organizational outcome, and enabling leadership (i.e., enabling the adaptive process through adaptive space) as a critical form of leadership for adaptive organizations.

AB The use of university-industry collaboration in the innovation process is viewed as a major driver of firm competitiveness. The organizational dynamics underlying successful external relationships, however, remain poorly understood. Using longitudinal case studies of 15 innovation projects, we examine how firms with varying degrees of experience in collaborating with universities and public research organizations rely on different social capital dimensions to achieve successful collaborations. We find that experienced firms establish external collaborations on the basis of cognitive social capital, but this basis is reinforced by relational social capital over time. Conversely, less experienced firms initially base their university collaborations on relational social capital, which is reinforced by cognitive social capital over time. Based on these findings, we theorize on the interplay of different dimensions of social capital in university-industry collaborations over time. Our study has important implications for the management of collaborative innovation projects. In particular, it provides guidance to enable less experienced firms to develop successful collaborations with university partners.

AB Purpose From the perspective of the economic theory of complementarity, the purpose of this paper is to examine how internal collaboration and external competencies would provoke and strengthen each other, and subsequently enhance organizational innovation capability. Design/methodology/approach The survey data were collected from 201 manufacturing firms and checked for common method variance, validity and reliability. Structural equation modeling was then used to test the hypothetical complementarity effect. Findings The results suggest that internal collaboration (as a manifestation of exploitative learning) and external competencies, which include supply network flexibility and supplier operational capabilities (as manifestation of exploratory learning), do in fact compensate for each other's deficiencies. Complementary deployment of internal collaboration and external competencies enhances each other's contribution to innovation capability. Practically, the study indicates that organizations should consider making concerted efforts to develop internal collaboration, supply network flexibility and supplier operational capability as a bundle. Originality/value Extensive discussions exist in the literature on exploration and exploitation being essential components of innovation and their conflicting impact on innovation efficiency and effectiveness. But how an organization should operationally develop supply chain competencies in order to maximize overall innovation capability still remains largely an unanswered question. The current study advances the research on the inter-relationships between exploration and exploitation by empirically demonstrating the complementary nature of internal collaboration and external competencies in developing sustainable innovation capabilities.

AB This paper proposes that the frequently established association between alliances and performance can be further explained by the alliance management capability. It unfolds some relationships that are encapsulated in the simple link between the alliance-related construct and the performance measures. The research hypothesis formed a structural model and the results confirmed that the proposed moderating role for the alliance management capability is significant and that alliances are effectively used for growing and for innovating. The main outcomes are: (a) a discussion and a test of 'what is' the alliance management capability; (b) a better understanding of the reasons why alliances enhance performance, namely by leveraging growth and innovation.

AB Investments in innovation activities involve uncertainty. Abandonments of innovative projects are frequent and can entail great losses. Interorganizational collaboration can help a firm to leverage and complement its own competencies and technologies, contrasting the factors that may cause the abandonment of innovation activities. This article shows that firms collaborating with a wider network of external partners to conduct their innovation activities are less likely to abandon them. The article also analyses how different categories of partners among customers & suppliers, competitors, consultants & private R&D institutions, universities & public R&D institutions are associated with the risk of innovation abandonment. Finally, the results show that international collaborations are more likely associated with innovation abandonment than domestic ones. Strategic and theoretical implications are drawn.

AB In this paper we undertake a quantitative review of the existing literature on parks and incubators to identify their foundations from a longitudinal perspective. To do so, we searched records in the SSCI database from 1990 to 2015 and identified 318 citing documents, which we split into four periods of 5 years each, to identify the interactions and path dependence that exist between different foundations of research. We evaluate the evolution of the theoretical foundations of this research line taking into account changes in citations over time. We also identify areas of future research closely connected with the theoretical foundations already identified. For this purpose, we used two bibliometric techniques-co-citation analysis and bibliographic coupling-that enable us to assess the thematic similarity between scientific publications based on overlaps in their referencing patterns.

AB In this paper, we investigate the effects of multiple project team membership on individual and team learning. Data from 435 members of 85 project teams shows that, at the individual level, membership variety has a positive impact on individual learning. Moreover, this positive relationship is stronger for individuals with an average need for cognition, in comparison to individuals with a high or a low need for cognition. At the project team level, the simultaneous inter-organizational memberships of a project team have a positive impact on the team?s external learning. However, the simultaneous intra-organizational project team memberships negatively moderate this positive relationship. Furthermore, cross-level analyses show that individual learning has a positive impact on both internal and external team learning. Our findings are relevant for project management practice as they suggest ways in which work design can be configured to increase individual and team learning.

AB The majority of previous Regional Innovation System (RIS) studies generally provide a rather static overview of the roles of innovation-creating actors. This article explores a single RIS in Trentino in Italy. The case shows that the roles of three actors (i.e., the provincial government, academia/research centers, and firms) are vital in creating the RIS, and that the provincial-level government policy is important in supporting the innovation activities of regional research institutions and firms aimed at developing their international connections. The public-private research collaboration and international connections of these actors are the key determinants of the development of an advanced RIS, but have largely been ignored in the extant RIS literature. This article extends the existing RIS and Triple Helix research to an international dimension, highlighting the complementary role of international connections within the RIS, thus reflecting a shift toward Quadruple Helix.

After two decades of research, however, a systematisation of these three sets of studies is still lacking. Thus, this paper contributes to the existing literature providing a comprehensive framework of factors affecting innovation diffusion between organisations. Specifically it evidences phases of innovation diffusion process, clarifies the role of innovator, adopters and intermediaries and evidences actions that policy-makers can implement to support it.

AB Forming strategic partnerships, particularly university partnerships, is among the important aspects of companies' innovation strategies that shape their innovation performance. While research has uncovered many macro-level attributes of such partnerships, the micro-level, including the human side, of these inter-organizational relationships is only partly understood. We especially lack an understanding of how individual, manager-level characteristics facilitate company collaboration with partners such as universities. Applying a micro-foundational lens and building on 10 qualitative case studies, we identify how companies' human capital helps overcome barriers and enhance the drivers of university-industry collaboration. We propose a two-dimensional framework consisting of companies' human capital components and their managerial roles for university partnerships-attitudinal, relational, and cognitive-to guide future research on human capital in the context of university-industry strategic partnerships. The framework will also assist managers and recruiters in better understanding the role of human capital in their collaborations with universities.

AB We study how industrial clusters in three different life phases both influence and moderate total factor productivity (TFP) of other co-located industries or clusters. A multilevel regression model is applied to panel data, 1993-2012, from the Pearl River Delta, China. Our empirical results show that emerging clusters have negative effects on other co-located industries' or clusters' TFP while mature clusters have positive effects. Emerging clusters positively moderate TFP, while mature clusters negatively moderate TFP of other co-located industries or clusters; declining clusters only have direct positive impact on TFP of other co-located industries or clusters.

AB Interactions between public research organisations (PROs) and firms may contribute to innovation and production-related benefits for firms and intellectual and economic benefits for researchers. This paper studies the impact of different channels (traditional, bi-directional, services and commercial) on the benefits received by firms and researchers in Costa Rica. We conclude that the traditional channel may generate benefits related to firms' short-term production activities and also their long-term innovation activities. However, it is not relevant to explaining the benefits for researchers. Strengthening collaboration networks using the traditional channel seems to be the mechanism to improve the contribution of PROs to innovation in industry. Contrary to expectations, the bi-directional channel is not significant in explaining the intellectual benefits for researchers, but it helps to explain the economic benefits for researchers and also both types of benefits for firms. Thus, it does not explain the quality of interactions from the researcher's point of view, but it explains it for firms.

AB This study examines the determinants of performance of cross-border mergers and acquisitions (cross-border M & As) in developed markets initiated by firms from emerging markets. Drawing on social network theory and organizational innovation literature, we hypothesize that business ties of the acquiring firm increase performance of cross-border M & As via enhancing the acquiring firm's technological innovation capability and that environmental turbulence strengthens this mediating model. Moreover, the interplay of cultural distance and technological innovation capability would decrease performance of cross-border M & As. To test the model, we collected data from 186 Chinese firms initiating cross-border M & As in developed markets. As predicted, we found that (1) technological innovation capability of the acquiring firm positively mediates the relationship between business ties and performance of cross-border M & As; (2) environmental turbulence positively moderates the relationship between business ties and technological innovation capability; and (3) cultural distance negatively moderates the relationship between technological innovation capability and performance of cross border M & As.

AB Despite the omnipresent popularity of the resource-based view of the firm, our understanding of how firms convert resource acquisition into performance returns remains something of a black box. We seek to unpack this problem in this study. Building on the resource-based view and combining insights from organizational learning theory, this paper develops a theoretical model consisting of seven hypotheses in which resource purchase, resource attraction, and resource internal development are positively related to new venture performance, and in which learning capability mediates these relationships. We also posit that resource acquisition methods augment the learning capability of the firm en route to securing superior new venture performance. We test these hypotheses using survey data from new ventures in China. The results indicate that all three methods of resource acquisition have positive effects on new venture performance, that resource attraction and internal development have positive effects on learning capability in new ventures, and that learning capability mediates the relationship between these two resource acquisition practices and new venture performance. We put forward implications for theory and practice to close the work.

AB The study examined the extent to which lack of access to external funding constitutes a barrier to innovation for small businesses operating in traditional industries. The findings indicate that, these businesses do not view lack of access to funding as a barrier to innovation for any of the four types of innovation: product, process, marketing, or organizational. However, for most of the innovations they promoted, the levels of innovation were relatively low, and which naturally entails relatively low risk to businesses. The findings also indicate that, there is a relationship between product and marketing levels of innovation and lack of access to external funding. The study's contribution lies in its focus on small businesses operating in traditional industries-businesses which though, essential to economic growth, have garnered less separate attention in the innovation sphere. The study points to a vicious circle in which these businesses do not promote innovation at high levels that would advance their own competitive advantage and require external funding. Because this funding is not within their reach, they continue promoting low-level innovation, and so on and so forth. The study may practically contribute by assisting policymakers as they draw plans dedicated to supporting innovation in small businesses.

We propose a U-shaped relationship between the presence of market competitors for a member firm and the firm's joint R&D output with other consortium members, and examine how the relationship is mediated by interactions with other members at the firm level and moderated by collaborative efforts at the consortium level. Using a unique sample of 320 firms from 52 R&D consortia in China, we find support for our predictions. This multi-level study extends our understanding of competition and cooperation in multi-party networks and provides insights for creating a balance between the two forces that is conducive to innovation.

AB Relationships drive numerous organizational capabilities. While this is generally acknowledged, many of the most widely used frameworks guiding research and practice in human resource management (HRM) do not explicitly incorporate social capital and social network factors in their designs, despite recognition that relationships are influential. In this paper, we argue for an explicit integration and application of social capital mechanisms in strategic HRM frameworks. We illustrate how a relationship lens can contribute to strategic HRM thinking at the individual level using extensions of the job characteristics model, at the group level by enhancing the design of effective work groups, and at the organizational level by augmenting the HR architecture. Further, consistent with the emerging co-evolution perspective on microfoundations of organizational outcomes, we propose that social capital and its development should be considered an input to HRM policies and practices, an element in implementation processes, and an outcome of HR activities. The proposed ideas both fill a gap in current strategic HRM theory and practice and challenge some of the basic assumptions guiding much of the work in this area. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

AB Integrating the conventional models with the emerging models, we propose a learning-based view of internationalization for multinational enterprise (MNE), especially for MNE latecomers as the new species of MNE from the emerging economies. Built upon the duality lens and transaction value perspective, this learning-based view frames the pattern of cross-border learning in terms of both learning motive and learning capability as a learning trajectory, with distinctive entry strategies as the primary applications of such learning trajectories. The learning trajectories on the dimensions of exploitative and exploratory learning as well as unilateral and bilateral leaning jointly constitute an overall framework of MNE evolution with cross-border learning as its central theme, especially in the process of an accelerated internationalization. In particular, we frame cross-border alliance as a special form for bilateral learning in terms of co-exploitation and co-exploration, which motivates and enables the accelerated internationalization of MNE latecomers. Finally, we identify four major learning-based issues as new "big questions" to reflect the emerging paradigm shift from hierarchy-based unilateral exploitation to network-based bilateral exploration with the theme that hierarchy is best for exploiting the extant core competence, while strategic alliance is best for exploring a novel core competence.

We found that teacher human capital that is specific to a setting and task, and some indicators of teacher social capital, predicted student performance improvement. At the team level, average educational attainment and horizontal tie strength were significant predictors of student improvement. We provide some evidence that team horizontal tie strength and density moderate the relationship between teacher ability and student performance. Implications of our multilevel analysis for theory, research, and policy are discussed.

AB From a perspective of the resource-based view, this paper analyses the inter-connection between technology adoption and creation in affiliates of multinational enterprises (MNEs) in an emerging economy. Operating below the international technological frontier, multinational affiliates are more motivated to adopt technologies already existent from their MNEs than create new technologies, as the former already gives them competitive advantages over local firms. When technology creation is required, multinational affiliates will adopt further technology-based resources from their MNEs as they are unavailable in an emerging economy. As a result, technology adoption is a necessary but not sufficient condition for multinational affiliates to conduct technology creation. Given that networks are particularly important for working around institutional voids in the context of an emerging economy, this paper also investigates the different roles of R&D support from internal and external networks of multinational affiliates in technology adoption and creation. Hypotheses are tested and partially supported based on unique data from 465 multinational affiliates in China. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this article is to study the curvilinear effect on pioneering orientation of one of its key relational backgrounds: strength of ties. The study is based on a sample of 224 companies in the footwear industry in Spain. A hierarchical regression analysis was performed. The results show a curvilinear U-shaped relationship between the strength of ties and pioneering orientation. This curvilinear relationship is increasingly pronounced as scanning capabilities grow. Managers wishing to develop a pioneering orientation should avoid excessive levels of strength in their ties and unduly low levels. Furthermore, firms might benefit from developing scanning capability.

AB Interorganizational relationships have attracted much scholarly attention in the last two decades. Despite the significant advances made in this field, the literature still largely relies on assumptions that overlook core features of interorganizational relationships. We build on the organizational research on pluralism to evaluate and identify opportunities to extend the literature on interorganizational relationships. Drawing on a synthesis of the last 20 years of research (1996-2016) on interorganizational relationships, we discuss four major "blind spots" concerning (1) the assumption of symmetry between parties or the focal party's perception is taken to reflect the whole relationship (single-party focus), (2) the assumption of uniform relationships between parties (single-valence focus), (3) the assumption of an interorganizational phenomenon within one level of analysis (single-level focus), and (4) the assumption of universal time (focus on a single conceptualization of time). Through an analysis of exemplary studies, we discuss how and when overcoming each of these blind spots provides novel insights to revisit theoretical mechanisms concerning the functioning of interorganizational relationships. We also identify a coherent set of strategies to address each blind spot. We advance the literature by articulating a pluralistic perspective to guide future research into core questions about interorganizational relationships.

AB Purpose Analyzing the entrepreneurial ecosystem related to the ARCA consortium, the purpose of this paper is to study the relationships among the start-up firms inside an incubator.
   Design/methodology/approach Thanks to the adoption of the relationships concentric model and the density concentric model, the paper highlights the role of relational conditions for innovative projects in partnership among the incubated firms. Reflections herein are tested via a qualitative research approach based on a single case study: the ARCA consortium.
   Findings This research found that about 32 percent of relationships inside the incubator support the emergence of short-term relationships among the incubated firms. Furthermore, about 18 percent of the relationships support the emergence of strong collaborative strategies for the implementation of long-term relationships resulting in innovative pathways: innovative projects in partnership.
   Originality/value The most interconnected firms inside the incubator are those that play a central role also in the innovation pathway developing the higher number of innovative project in partnership. This finding emphasizes a correlation between collaborative relationships and innovation inside an incubator ecosystem.

AB This study articulates and tests the direct and indirect relationships between the company's innovation orientation (IO), its collection and dissemination (C&D) of external information among the organisational members, and the level of success of its innovation collaborations involving customers, suppliers, and research organisations. Our conceptual framework is developed based on an integration of the literatures on organisational capabilities, marketing, innovation, and management control. We empirically test these relationships on a sample of 117 small-to-medium enterprises (SME) operating in Low-to-Medium-Tech (LMT) manufacturing industries. Partial Least Squares (PLS) results reveal that the relationship between the firm's IO and the success of its customer collaborations is partially mediated by the C&D of external information. We also find that the relationship between the firm's IO and the success of supplier collaborations is direct, and that the C&D of external information has no effect on the success of such collaborations. Finally the relationship between IO, C&D of external information and the success of research organisation collaborations is found to be indirect. Overall, these findings suggest that developing successful innovation collaborations in LMT sectors requires that SME managers start by building an internal culture that promotes innovation, learning and openness to the external environment.

AB While strategic alliances have emerged in recent years as common and important structural vehicles for business development, surprisingly little is known about how collaborative activities are organized and administered within these governance structures. We see classic organizational scholarship as useful insofar as it both provides clear classifications that distinguish alternative intraorganizational designs and explicates how they affect the inner workings of organizations. Existing alliance classification schemes based on type of collaborative activity, partner characteristics, or legal structure, on the other hand, rarely delineate important differences of how collaborative work is organized among partners. We seek to redress this shortcoming by developing a framework of alliance structural parameters based on classic organizational design considerations. Specifically we identify and discuss five key design parameters for alliances: the structural interface between partners, the structural intraface within partners, and the specialization, formalization, and centralization of the alliance organization. We show how consideration of these five parameters provides a deeper understanding of alliance governance and suggest how partner organizations can achieve differential levels of connectivity and steering for their collaborative ventures.

AB International joint ventures (IJVs) have long been considered a vibrant venue for innovation, one source of sustainable competitive advantage. Nonetheless, there is a paucity of research that seeks to understand what determines their innovative performance. We draw attention to and examine the control structure of IJVs as a determinant of innovation. Using the complementary lenses of local embeddedness, the liability of outsidership, and open innovation, we argue that foreign managerial control reduces IJV innovation and that equity ownership balance between foreign and local parent firms and affiliation of IJVs with local market business groups weaken this negative relationship. Using panel data of 48 IJVs in Korea during the periods between 2000 and 2016, we find empirical support for these arguments. This study contributes to the literature by extending our understanding of how to design IJVs for enhancing innovative output and consequently improving their sustainability.

AB This study seeks to explain how the innovation potential entailed in the structural characteristics of a diverse alliance portfolio can be leveraged by two different alliance management capabilities of a focal firm: portfolio coordination and proactive partner selection. An analysis of German biotechnology firms, based on database and survey data, indicates that each alliance management capability positively interacts with portfolio diversity to foster innovation. In addition, regarding their joint influence as capability bundle on the portfolio diversity-innovation link, portfolio coordination and proactive partner selection seem to substitute rather than complement each other. These results suggest that firms realize innovation benefits from a diverse set of external alliance partners only when they focus on and apply internal coordination or partner selection routines to manage these alliances, thus acting as either portfolio coordinators or portfolio configurators.

AB Recent studies suggest that the effectiveness of open innovation (OI) can significantly differ among firms. One possible reason is the different ways of implementing OI strategies. Another is the ignorance of the explicit role of business model (BM). In this study, we integrate the two plausible explanations by exploring the impact of the interplay between different OI implementations and BM on firms' new product development (NPD) speed. Empirical results from a survey of 265 Chinese firms show that both OI breadth and OI depth positively affect NPD speed. More importantly, we find that an efficient BM strengthens the positive effect of OI depth while it weakens the positive effect of OI breadth. We also find that a novel BM strengthens the positive effect of OI breadth while it weakens the positive effect of OI depth. This research contributes to OI literature by underscoring the importance of matching the BMs to the OI strategies to facilitate NPD.
